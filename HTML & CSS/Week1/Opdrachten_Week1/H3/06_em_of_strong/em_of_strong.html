        <p>The Nexus 5 (2015) will be unveiled on Tuesday, September 29 according to a report
            from <strong>CNET</strong>. <strong>CNET</strong> does not provide a<br>
            source for this information, but recent, unrelated speculation also suggested this date.
            <strong>CNET</strong> also adds weight to the rumors<br>
            that two devices will be revealed at this launch; the smaller Nexus made by LG and the larger version by Huawei.
        </p>
        <p>This news might have inadvertently revealed the release date for <strong>Android Marshmallow</strong> too.
            Google usually drops its latest<br> Nexus devices at the same time as the latest version of Android,
            as it did last year with the Nexus 6 and Android 5.0 Lollipop.<br>Will we see this trend continue in 2015?
            It won't be long until we find out.</p>
