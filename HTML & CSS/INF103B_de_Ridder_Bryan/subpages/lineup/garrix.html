    <p><b>Martijn Gerard Garritsen</b>, better known by his stage name <b>Martin Garrix</b> (stylized as <b>Mar+in Garri&#215;</b>),
        is a Dutch DJ, record producer and musician. He is currently ranked number 3 on <i>DJ Mag</i>'s Top 100 DJs. In
        2016, he founded the label <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/STMPD_RCRDS'>STMPD RCRDS</a> months after leaving
        Spinnin' Records.</p>
    <p>Garritsen learned to play guitar at age 8. In 2004, he expressed interest in becoming a DJ after seeing <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ti&#235;sto'>Ti&#235;sto</a> perform at the Olympic games in Athens. He took
        particular inspiration from the track "Traffic", prompting him to download specialist software, FL Studio, and
        enabling him to start composing. In 2013, he graduated from the Herman Brood Academy, a production school in
        Utrecht. Garritsen ghost writes tracks for other artists, and despite this, only one in fifty of his tracks have
        made it out to the public. In an interview when asked about his social class, Garritsen said middle-class. He
        also said his 'dream mentor' was Calvin Harris.</p>
    <h3>2012: Early career</h3>
    <p>Garritsen had his beginnings with the songs "BFAM" (with Julian Jordan) and "Just Some Loops", a collaboration
        with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Noise'>TV Noise</a> that appeared on the compilation album <i>Loop
            Masters Essential, Volume 2</i>. He signed to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinnin'
        >Spinnin' Records</a> in 2012, releasing "Error 404" through the label.</p>
    <h3>2013&#8211;14: Breakthrough</h3>

    <p>In 2013, Garritsen co-released "Torrent" with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Samson'>Sidney Samson</a>
        on Ti&#235;sto's <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Freedom'>Musical Freedom</a> label. He gained fame
        through his own solo release "Animals" released on 16 June 2013 on Dutch record label Spinnin' Records, becoming
        a hit in a great number of charts in Europe, and became the youngest person to reach the No. 1 spot on Beatport.
        The track appears on Hardwell's album <i>Hardwell presents 'Revealed Volume 4'</i>. On 30 September 2013,
        Garritsen released a remix of "Project T" by Sander Van Doorn and Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike which quickly
        hit No. 1 on the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatport'>Beatport</a> charts. He appeared on <i>DJ
            Magazine</i>'s top 100 DJs list in 2013 as a new entry at number 40. In 2014, he appeared on
        <i>DJ Magazine</i>'s top 100 DJs list at number 4.</p>
    <p>In November 2013, Garritsen signed a deal with Scooter Braun's <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_Braun'>Scooter
        Braun</a> Projects (later School Boy Records). In December 2013, he released "Wizard" with Jay Hardway, the song
        has peaked to number 6 in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium'>Belgium</a> and number 17 in the
        Netherlands. His collaboration with Firebeatz, "Helicopter", placed No. 1 on the Beatport Top 100 charts for 2
        weeks. He performed at <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Music_Festival'>Ultra Music Festival</a> 2014,
        where he debuted several new and unreleased tracks, including collaborations with Dillon Francis, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardwell'>Hardwell</a> and Afrojack.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Garritsen released "Proxy" as a free download. He released a song with <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/MOTi'>MOTi</a> with the title "Virus (How About Now)" which was later in the
        year as well as his collaboration with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrojack'>Afrojack</a> releasing "Turn
        Up the Speakers" which Afrojack and Garritsen both premiered at Ultra Music Festival.</p>
    <h3>2015: More melodic sound and split from Spinnin' Records
    </h3>

    <p>In 2015, Garritsen experimented with progressive house and started producing progressive style apart from his
        signature big room sound. On 6 February 2015, he released the track "Forbidden Voices" as a gift for 10 million
        likes on his Facebook page. In February 2015, he released the single "Don't Look Down" featuring Usher. He also
        released two video versions for it on Vevo, "Towel Boy" and "Towel Girl." The track was written by Garritsen, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/James_'>James 'JHart' Abrahart</a> and Busbee. It
        peaked at No. 3 on the <i>Billboard</i> Dance Club Songs.</p>
    <p>In an interview with <i>DigitalSpy</i> in early 2015, Garritsen noted that Usher is a "humble" artist and a great
        collaborator to whom he can direct input. He also worked with multi-Grammy winner <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sheeran'>Ed Sheeran</a> on a track called "Rewind Repeat It" which he
        played at Ultra Music Festival in Miami in March 2015. On 4 May 2015, he released a track with Ti&#235;sto,
        called "The Only Way Is Up". On 22 May 2015, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicii'>Avicii</a> released a
        lyric video of the song "Waiting for Love" co-produced by Garritsen. On 6 July 2015, Garritsen released the <i>Break
            Through The Silence</i> EP with Russian DJs Matisse and Sadko. Later, on 31 October 2015, he released a
        track titled "Poison" as a promotional single.</p>
    <p>On 26 August 2015, Garritsen made an announcement on social media regarding rumors he had terminated his
        agreements with the company Spinnin' Records and MusicAllStars Management in which he confirmed he was no longer
        working with the two companies. The cause was cited due to a "...difference of opinion between us regarding the
        reasonableness of the agreements." over ownership rights of his music. The major debate revolves around
        ownership of his first major hit "Animals," which was released when he was only 17 and lacking experience in
        contract negotiation. The post reads "From the beginning of this year I tried to get back the ownership rights
        of my music from Spinnin' Records and to keep my confidence in MAS. I am extremely disappointed that the
        discussions have not led to a change in the agreements or return of the ownership rights, and that is why I
        nullified them."</p>
    <p>In November 2015, after being split from Spinnin' Records, Garritsen announced that he would create his own
        record label.</p>
    <p>On 31 December 2015, Garritsen released "Bouncybob", his final track of the year, for free, which he had
        co-produced with Justin Mylo and Mesto.</p>
    <h3>2016: STMPD RCRDS and debut studio album</h3>
    <p>Garritsen launched his own record label called STMPD RCRDS in the first quarter of 2016. On 11 March 2016, he
        released his first single via STMPD RCRDS titled "Now That I've Found You", featuring the vocals of John Martin
        and Michel Zitron.</p>
    <p>On 20 February 2016, Garritsen announced that his debut album will be arriving this year via Twitter after the
        social media platform asked some of its content curators to use its new video platform to announce their plans
        for 2016. On 18 March 2016, he debuted a great part of his 2016 debut album at Ultra Music Festival, and chose
        to use his one-hour set to premiere ten new unreleased tracks, including collaborations with Jay Hardway, Julian
        Jordan, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shinoda'>Mike Shinoda</a> of Linkin Park, Ed Sheeran, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebe_Rexha'>Bebe Rexha</a> and Third Party along with AREA21, a music
        duo believed to be Garritsen himself with Maejor. On 27 May 2016, he released his second single "Lions in the
        Wild" with British DJ duo Third Party.</p>
    <p>On 13 June 2016, Garritsen released a promotional single titled "Oops" which became the E3 2016 anthem. On 26
        July 2016, it was announced that Garritsen signed a 'worldwide' contract with Sony Music International. He said
        in the release, "Their forward thinking approach to streaming and incredible roster of talented artists combined
        with their passion and understanding for my vision of the future of my music made this a no brainer." On 29 July
        2016, he released the track "In the Name of Love" with Bebe Rexha.</p>
    <p>On 22 August 2016, Garritsen made his first ever live performance of his own music, with Rexha on The Tonight
        Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, accompanied by The Tonight Show&#8217;s house band, The Roots.</p>
