    <p><b>Massive Attack</b> are an English trip hop group formed in 1988 in Bristol, consisting of Robert "3D" Del
        Naja, Grant "Daddy G" Marshall and formerly Andy "Mushroom" Vowles ("Mush"). Their debut album <i>Blue
            Lines</i> was released in 1991, with the single "Unfinished Sympathy" reaching the charts and later
        being voted the 63rd greatest song of all time in a poll by <i>NME</i>. 1998's <i>Mezzanine</i>, containing
        "Teardrop", and 2003's <i>100th Window</i> charted in the UK at number one. Both <i>Blue Lines</i> and <i>Mezzanine</i>
        feature in <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.</p>
    <p>The group has won numerous music awards throughout their career, including a Brit Award&#8212;winning Best
        British Dance Act, two MTV Europe Music Awards, and two Q Awards. They have released five studio albums that
        have sold over 11 million copies worldwide.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>DJs <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Daddy_G'>Daddy G</a> and <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Vowles'>Andrew Vowles</a> and graffiti artist-turned-rapper <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Del_Naja'>Robert Del Naja</a> met as members of partying
        collective The Wild Bunch. One of the first homegrown soundsystems in the UK, The Wild Bunch became dominant
        on the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol'>Bristol</a> club scene in the mid-1980s.</p>
    <p>Massive Attack started as a spin-off production trio in 1988, with the independently released song, "Any
        Love", sung by falsetto-voiced singer-songwriter Carlton McCarthy, and then, with considerable backing from
        Neneh Cherry, they signed to Circa Records in 1990&#160;&#8211; committing to deliver six studio albums and
        a "<i>best of</i>" compilation. Circa became a subsidiary of, and was later subsumed into, Virgin Records,
        which in turn was acquired by EMI. <i>Blue Lines</i> (1991), was co-produced by <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Dollar'>Jonny Dollar</a> and Cameron McVey, who also became
        their first manager. Geoff Barrow, who went on to form Portishead, was an intern and trainee tape operator
        at Bristol's Coach House studio when the album was recorded. McVey (credited at the time as 'Booga Bear')
        and his wife, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Neneh_Cherry'>Neneh Cherry</a> provided crucial financial
        support and in-kind assistance to the early careers of Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky during this
        period, even paying regular wages to them through their <i>Cherry Bear Organisation</i>. Massive Attack used
        guest vocalists, interspersed with Del Naja and Marshall's (initially Tricky's) own sprechgesang stylings,
        on top of what became regarded as an essentially British creative sampling production; a trademark sound
        that fused down-tempo hip hop, soul, reggae and other eclectic references, musical and lyrical.</p>
    <p>In the nineties, the trio became known for often not being able to easily get along with one another and
        working increasingly separately. Andy Vowles (Mushroom), who had once thought of himself as the trio's
        musical director, acrimoniously left Massive Attack in late 1999, after an ultimatum from the other two
        members to end the group immediately if he did not. Despite having taken Del Naja's side in the effective
        firing of Vowles and then participating in a show-of-unity webcast as a duo the following year, Grant
        Marshall (G) had also effectively left by 2001 in that he abandoned the studio altogether. Marshall returned
        to a studio role in 2005, having joined the touring line-up in 2003 and 2004.</p>
    <h3><i>Any Love</i> beginnings</h3>
    <p>Unsigned, Mushroom (Andy Vowles), Daddy G (Grant Marshall) and 3D (Robert Del Naja) put out "Any Love" as a
        single, co-produced by Bristol double-act Smith &amp; Mighty.</p>
    <h3<i>Blue Lines</i> and "Unfinished Sympathy"</h3>


    <p>3D co-wrote Neneh Cherry's "Manchild", which peaked at number 5 in the UK single chart. <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_McVey'>Cameron McVey</a> and Neneh Cherry helped them to record
        their first LP <i>Blue Lines</i>, partly in their house, and the album was released in 1991 on Virgin
        Records.</p>
    <p>The album used vocalists including <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Andy'>Horace Andy</a> and Shara
        Nelson, a former Wild Bunch cohort. MC's Tricky and Willie Wee, also once part of The Wild Bunch, featured,
        as well as Daddy G's voice on "Five Man Army". Neneh Cherry sang backing vocals on environmentalist anthem,
        "Hymn of the Big Wheel".</p>
    <p>That year they released "Unfinished Sympathy" as a single, a string-arranged track at Abbey Road studio,
        scored by Will Malone, that went on to be voted the 10th greatest song of all time in a poll by <i>The
            Guardian</i>.</p>
    <p>The group temporarily shortened their name to "Massive" on the advice of McVey to avoid controversy relating
        to the Gulf War. They went back to being "Massive Attack" for their next single, "Safe from Harm".</p>
    <h3><i>Protection</i> and Melankolic</h3>

    <p>After <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Shara_Nelson'>Shara Nelson</a> left, the band brought in Everything
        but the Girl's <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracey_Thorn'>Tracey Thorn</a> as a vocalist and released
        "Protection" on 26 September 1994.</p>
    <p>With McVey out of the picture, Massive Attack enlisted the production talents of former Wild Bunch <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellee_Hooper'>Nellee Hooper</a> to co-produce some songs on it, with
        Mushroom. Other tracks were co-produced by <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Insects'>The Insects</a>
        and 3D. A dub version, <i>No Protection</i>, was released the following year by Mad Professor.
        <i>Protection</i> won a Brit award for Best Dance Act. The other collaborators on <i>Protection</i> were
        Marius de Vries, Craig Armstrong, a Scottish classical pianist, and Tricky. Tricky's solo career was taking
        off at this time and he decided not to collaborate with Massive Attack after this.</p>
    <p>1994-5 was also the period of Portishead's <i>Dummy</i> and Tricky's <i>Maxinquaye</i> albums and the term
        "trip hop" was coined. The media started to refer to the "Bristol scene".</p>
    <p>In 1995, Massive Attack started a label distributed by Virgin/EMI, Melankolic, and signed Craig Armstrong and
        a number of other artists such as Horace Andy, Alpha, Sunna, and Day One. The trio espoused a
        non-interference philosophy that allowed the artists to make their albums in the way they wanted.</p>
    <p>The same year The Insects became unavailable for co-production and having parted ways with Nellee Hooper, the
        band were introduced to Neil Davidge, a relatively unknown producer whose main claim to fame thus far had
        been an association with anonymous dance-pop outfit DNA. The first track they worked on was "The Hunter Gets
        Captured by the Game", a cover version sung by Tracey Thorn for the <i>Batman Forever</i> soundtrack.
        Initially, Davidge was brought in as engineer, but soon became producer.</p>
    <p>The trio increasingly fractured in the lead up to the third album, Davidge having to co-produce the three
        producers' ideas separately. Mushroom was reported to be unhappy with the degree of the post-punk direction
        in which Del Naja, increasingly filling the production vacuum, was taking the band.</p>
    <p>In 1997, the group contributed to the film soundtrack of <i>The Jackal</i>, recording "Superpredators (Metal
        Postcard)", a number containing a sample of Siouxsie and the Banshees' "Mittageisen" and "Dissolved Girl", a
        new song with vocals by Sarah Jay (that was later remixed for the next album), which was featured at the
        beginning of the 1999 film The Matrix, although it was not on the official soundtrack.</p>
    <p>Later that year they released a single, "Risingson", from what would be their third album, <i>Mezzanine</i>.
    </p>
    <h3><i>Mezzanine</i>, Teardrop, the Vowles split and Marshall's absence
    </h3>

    <p><i>Mezzanine</i> was Massive Attack's most commercially successful album, selling nearly 4 million copies. <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Bruschini'>Angelo Bruschini</a> became their permanent lead
        guitarist both in recording and live.</p>
    <p>The lead single, after "Risingson" was "Teardrop", sung by Cocteau Twin Elizabeth Fraser. The song was
        accompanied by a video directed by Walter Stern, of an animatronic singing fetus. Horace Andy was invited
        back to sing on three songs, including "Angel" and a track the band made for the film <i>The Jackal</i>,
        "Dissolved Girl", sung by Sara Jay, was remixed for inclusion on the record.</p>
    <p><i>Mezzanine</i> went on to win a Q Award for Best Album as well as being nominated for a Mercury Award.</p>
    <p>Touring extensively, friction between Mushroom and the others came to a head. Mushroom was unhappy with the
        direction of the group, Del Naja's dominating role, and having to appear on tour.</p>
    <p>Around this time, Del Naja, with Davidge decamped into Ridge Farm studio with friends and band members of <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupine_Howl'>Lupine Howl</a> (made up of former members of the band
        Spiritualized, including Damon Reece who went on to be Massive Attack's permanent drummer and one of two
        live drummers) towards a fourth Massive Attack LP, taking things even further into a rock direction.</p>
    <p>2001 also saw the release of <i>Eleven Promos</i>, a DVD of all Massive Attack's 11 music videos thus far,
        including "Angel", a &#163;100,000+ promo</p>
    <h3>Del Naja's <i>100th Window</i>, Marshall's return and <i>Collected</i>
    </h3>


    <p>With Daddy G temporarily no longer involved in the studio, Davidge and Del Naja steered "LP4" on their own.
        Enlisting the vocals of <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin&#233;ad_O' Connor'>Sin&#233;ad O'Connor</a>
        and Horace Andy, <i>100th Window</i> was mastered in August 2002 and released in February 2003.</p>
    <p>Featuring no samples or cover versions, <i>100th Window</i> was not as critically well received in Britain as
        the other records, although the album received a warmer reception internationally; scoring a 75 out of 100
        on review aggregation site Metacritic. The group also collaborated with <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mos_Def'>Mos Def</a> on the track "I Against I", which appeared on
        the "Special Cases" single and the soundtrack for <i>Blade II</i>. "I Against I" is also notable as the only
        track from the <i>100th Window</i> sessions that features a writing credit from Daddy G.</p>
    <p>Also in 2003, Del Naja was arrested on child porn allegations, which were reported widely in the media. Del
        Naja was soon eliminated as a suspect (although he was charged with ecstasy possession and unable to get a
        US visa for a while) with Daddy G and fans proffering their support. The arrest affected the beginning of
        the <i>100th Window</i> tour schedule.</p>
    <p>Despite the difficulties of 2003, <i>100th Window</i> sold over a million copies and was toured extensively
        (including Queen Square, Bristol&#160;&#8211; a one-off sell out concert set up in the city centre park,
        which was seen as a homecoming).</p>
    <p>Afterwards, Del Naja and Davidge agreed to an offer from director Louis Leterrier, to score the entire
        soundtrack for <i>Danny The Dog</i>, starring Jet Li. Dot Allison, who had sung with the band on the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/100th_Window'>100th Window</a> tour, sang the end titles track,
        "Aftersun". Davidge also scored the soundtrack for the <i>Bullet Boy</i> film, with Del Naja on the end
        titles.</p>
    <p>In 2005, Daddy G started coming into the studio, although little came of the material. He decided to instead
        work with a production duo, Robot Club, in another studio, feeling that he would be more free to develop
        tracks in the way he wanted. Meanwhile, Del Naja and Davidge recorded with a number of different singers as
        well as creating a track named "Twilight", for UNKLE's <i>War Stories</i> album. Later that year, Massive
        Attack decided to release their contractually obliged compilation album <i>Collected</i> in 2006. They
        released it with a second disc, made up of previously released non-album songs and unreleased sketches.</p>
    <h3>"Weather Underground" / <i>Heligoland</i> era
    </h3>

    <p>In 2007, Del Naja and Davidge scored three soundtracks, <i>In Prison My Whole Life</i> (which featured a
        track called "Calling Mumia" with vocals by American rapper Snoop Dogg), <i>Battle in Seattle</i> and <i>Trouble
            the Water</i>.</p>
    <p>In February 2007, Massive Attack hosted a charity benefit for the Hoping Foundation, a charity for
        Palestinian children, cementing their reputation as one of Britain's politically engaged bands. In 2008, it
        was announced that Massive Attack were to curate the UK's Southbank Meltdown, a week-long event. It was
        suggested in interviews that this event would inspire Massive Attack back into action, having spent several
        years drifting towards the completion of their fifth studio album.</p>
    <p>Later that year, Del Naja and Daddy G headed to Damon Albarn's studios for some writing and jamming. Around
        this time, Davidge scored the soundtrack for a Paul McGuigan film, <i>Push</i> and in December, Del Naja
        completed the score for <i>44 Inch Chest</i> with The Insects and Angelo Badalamenti.</p>
    <p>Davidge and Del Naja got back together in 2009 with Daddy G to finish the fifth album, incorporating bits of
        the Albarn material. Later it was announced that the band were to headline the 2009 <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bestival'>Bestival</a> festival, and soon after that they were to
        tour the UK and Europe. In May, Robert Del Naja's instrumental "Herculaneum", featured in the film
        <i>Gomorra</i>,
        won an Italian award for Best Song. Later that month, Del Naja and Marshall picked up a special Ivor Novello
        award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.</p>
    <p>On 29 May Jonny Dollar died of cancer aged 45, survived by his wife and 4 children. Dollar was the programmer
        and hands-on producer behind <i>Blue Lines</i>, writing some of the melodies that were the basis for the
        string arrangements "Unfinished Sympathy".</p>
    <p>On 25 August their new EP, <i>Splitting the Atom</i>, was announced. The other new tracks on the EP were
        revealed to be Tunde Adebimpe's "Pray For Rain", Martina Topley-Bird's "Psyche" and Guy Garvey's
        "Bulletproof Love". The latter two tracks appear as remixes of the album.</p>
    <p>The fifth album was released on 12 November 2009, and it was called <i>Heligoland</i>, after the German
        archipelago of Heligoland. Del Naja said "I think it's got definitely a more organic feel". The opening
        track, "Pray For Rain" featured guest vocals of TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe, and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Albarn'>Damon Albarn</a> and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Sandoval'>Hope Sandoval</a> also provide guest vocals on the
        album.</p>
    <h4>EPs</h4>
    <p>Robert Del Naja told the New Statesman of his decision not to tour in Israel, due to the continuing <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_blockade'>Israeli blockade</a> of the Gaza strip.</p>
    <p>An Atlas Air EP was announced for 1 November as a vinyl/digital only release in aid of Warchild, also
        featuring the <i>Heligoland</i> leftover track RedLight, plus a remix by Warp artist Clark.</p>
    <p>Del Naja said in October, to the Spinner website, that his plans were now for "unorthodox" release of several
        EPs in 2011, rather than an album.</p>
    <p>On 10 October 2011, a limited 12" was announced, called "Four Walls / Paradise Circus". The record contains a
        long-awaited collaboration with Burial, as well as his remix of "Paradise Circus". The record is limited to
        1000 copies.</p>
    <p>The song "Paradise Circus" is used during the opening credits of <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC'>BBC</a> series Luther, and during the ending scene of the 6th
        episode of the second season 2 of Revenge, whilst the song has also been remixed by several prominent
        artists, such as Canadian electronic music duo Zeds Dead.</p>
    <p>On 11 December 2011, their song "Splitting The Atom" premi&#232;red as the theme song on <i>Luck</i>, an HBO
        television series starring Dustin Hoffman.</p>
    <h3><i>Ritual Spirit</i> EP, new album, and the return of Tricky
    </h3>
    <p>In a 2013 interview for his first solo art show since 2008, Del Naja confirmed that not only was a new
        Massive Attack album in the works, but that rumours of a reunion with Tricky were indeed true. Tricky hasn't
        been featured on a Massive Attack album since 1994's <i>Protection</i>.</p>
    <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <p>'The idea is to put a record out next year', he says. 'We actually get on really well at the moment
            because we don't spend time in the studio together', he says with a wry grin. 'Me and Tricky wrote some
            new tracks in Paris last year, which haven't seen the light of day yet&#160;&#8211; but that was fun.
            They should be on the next album.'</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>On 5 February 2014, it was confirmed that Massive Attack would headline at Secret Solstice, a new music
        festival in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav&#237;k'>Reykjav&#237;k</a> on 20 June through 22
        June. On 21 February 2015, it was confirmed through the Massive Attack Facebook page that they would be
        collaborating with Run the Jewels.</p>
    <p>On 21 January 2016, the iPhone application "Fantom" was released. The application was developed by a team
        including Massive Attack's Robert Del Naja and let users hear parts of four new songs by remixing them in
        real-time, using the phone&#8217;s location, movement, clock, heartbeat, and camera. On 28 January 2016,
        Massive Attack released a new EP, <i>Ritual Spirit</i>, which includes the four songs released on Fantom.
        The EP was written and produced by Robert Del Naja and long term collaborator, Euan Dickinson. It is their
        first release since the 2011 <i>Four Walls / Paradise Circus</i> collaboration with Burial, and the first
        time since 1994 that fellow trip hop musician Tricky has been featured on Massive Attack content. Artists
        such as Scottish hip-hop group Young Fathers, London rapper <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots_Manuva'>Roots Manuva</a> and singer <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Azekel'>Azekel</a> also featured on the EP.</p>
    <p>On 26 July 2016, Massive Attack previewed three new songs: "Come Near Me," "The Spoils," and "Dear Friend" on
        Fantom, an iPhone application on which they previously previewed the four songs from the <i>Ritual
            Spirit</i> EP. On 29 July 2016, Massive attack released a new single, "The Spoils," which includes "The
        Spoils" and "Come Near Me" which were both previewed on Fantom. "The Spoils" features vocals from American
        singer-songwriter and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazzy_Star'>Mazzy Star</a> frontwoman Hope
        Sandoval, and "Come Near Me" features British vocalist Ghostpoet. A music video for "Come Near Me," directed
        by Ed Morris, and featuring Kosovan actress Arta Dobroshi, was released the same day as the single. The
        videoclip for "The Spoils," featuring Cate Blanchett, and directed by Australian director John Hillcoat, was
        released on 9 August 2016.</p>
    <h2>Musical style</h2>
    <p>Some of their most noted songs have been without choruses and have featured dramatically atmospheric
        dynamics, conveyed through either distorted guitar crescendos, lavish orchestral arrangements or prominent,
        looped/shifting basslines, underpinned by high and exacting production values, involving sometimes copious
        digital editing and mixing. The pace of their music has often been slower than prevalent British dance music
        at the time. These and other psychedelic, soundtrack-like and DJist sonic techniques, formed a much-emulated
        style journalists began to dub "trip hop" from the mid-nineties onwards, though in an interview in 2006, G
        said, "We used to hate that terminology [trip-hop] so bad,' laughs. 'You know, as far we were concerned,
        Massive Attack music was unique, so to put it in a box was to pigeonhole it and to say, "Right, we know
        where you guys are coming from."</p>
    <h2>Other projects</h2>
    <h3>'Fire Sale' exhibition</h3>
    <p>Del Naja's solo art show was held at the Lazarides gallery in central London, England, UK from 24 May to 22
        June 2013. The show's content spanned a period of over twenty years and featured many of the art pieces that
        Del Naja created for Massive Attack. Each piece, reinterpreted especially for the exhibition, was
        hand-printed and finished. The show also featured three one-off 'digital infinity mirrors', two of which
        contained phrases supplied by Reprieve that were extracted from drone pilot dialogues. Del Naja performed as
        a DJ during the opening night on 23 May 2013.</p>
    <h3>Massive Attack vs Adam Curtis</h3>
    <p>Del Naja conceived and designed an eight-night festival with filmmaker Adam Curtis&#160;&#8212;in
        collaboration with UVA (United Visual Artists)&#8212; that premiered in Manchester, England, UK in July
        2013. The festival featured Curtis's film, unofficially titled <i>The Plan</i>, which was projected on a
        huge screen surrounding the audience, while music from Massive Attack was interweaved throughout the film.
        Del Naja, who orchestrated the film's soundtrack, described the experience as a &#8220;collective
        hallucination&#8221; and the film was also shown at the Manchester Festival in July 2013. The show was
        performed at the Ruhr International Festival in Germany in August 2013 and the Park Avenue Armory in New
        York City in September 2013.</p>
    <h2>Activism and politics</h2>
    <p>Del Naja has been critical of the government policies of the UK. He was strongly opposed to the 2003 war
        against Iraq, and with fellow musician Damon Albarn personally paid for full page adverts in the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/NME'>NME</a> magazine.</p>
    <p>In 2005 Del Naja organised and performed at a charity concert in Bristol for Tsunami Relief with Adrian Utley
        and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Barrow'>Geoff Barrow</a> of Portishead. The two-night event
        featured Massive Attack, Portishead, Robert Plant, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coral'>The
            Coral</a> and Damon Albarn. Del Naja and Marshall performed three shows in 2005 in support of Hoping, an
        organisation that helps raise money, support projects for Palestinian youth in refugee camps in the Gaza
        strip and the west bank, Lebanon and Syria.</p>
    <p>Del Naja, musicians Damon Albarn and Brian Eno, and <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Visual_Artists'>United Visual Artists</a> contributed to a
        demonstration against the renewal of the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_nuclear_programme'>Trident
            nuclear programme</a> that was held on board the Arctic Sunrise on the River Thames in 2007.</p>
    <p>In 2008, Massive Attack curated the annual Meltdown festival on London's south bank. During the two weeks of
        live performance, cinema and art, they worked with human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith and his Reprieve
        organisation which uses the law to enforce the human rights of prisoners.</p>
    <p>In 2010, the video for shot by Oliver Chanarin and Adam Bloomberg for the song "Saturday come slow",
        featuring Damon Albarn, drew attention to the use of music in torture. In 2010, Massive Attack donated the
        income from a Lincoln car commercial to the clean up campaign after the BP oil spill disaster.</p>
    <p>Massive Attack donated all proceeds from their 2010 EP Atlas Air this week for War Child, a charity the band
        previously supported when they contributed to the HELP album.</p>
    <p>Massive Attack have previously played two shows in Israel, but have declined recent offers. They have
        described this "not an action of aggression towards the Israeli people" but "towards the [Israeli]
        government and its policies", arguing that "the Palestinians [in Gaza and the west bank] have no access to
        the same fundamental benefits that the Israelis do."</p>
    <p>Del Naja and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Yorke'>Thom Yorke</a> of <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead'>Radiohead</a> threw an unofficial party at the occupied <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS'>UBS</a> building in the city of London in December 2011, in support
        for the international Occupy movement.</p>
    <p>On 14 November 2012, on the eve of the Bristol Mayor election the band caused some surprise by endorsing
        independent millionaire and former LibDem George Ferguson, citing the need for a mayor who would help
        facilitate creative projects to the city, and wasn't simply following a party political agenda. Previously,
        Del Naja had openly criticised Ferguson for being a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers, an
        organisation dating back to the 16th century which had many connections with the Bristol slave trade.</p>
    <p>During their concert at Istanbul, Massive Attack named those who died in anti-government protests on the
        outdoor screen at their back with following sentences, <i>Their killers are still out there</i> and <i>We
            won't forget Soma</i>.</p>
    <p>In July Del Naja and Marshall visited the Bourge-El Barajneh refugee camp in Lebanon to meet with Palestinian
        volunteers at an educational centre. The band's profit from the show in Byblos was donated to the
        centre.</p>
