    <p><b>Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor</b> (born 7 November 1996), better known by her stage name <b>Lorde</b>
        (pronounced "lord"), is a New Zealand singer-songwriter. Born in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Takapuna'
        >Takapuna</a> and raised in
        Devonport, Auckland, she became interested in performing as a child. In her early teens, she signed with <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Group'>Universal Music Group</a> and was later
        paired with the songwriter and record producer Joel Little, who has co-written and produced most of Lorde's
        works. Her first major release, <i>The Love Club EP</i>, was commercially released in March 2013. The EP reached
        number two on the national record charts of New Zealand and Australia.</p>
    <p>In mid-2013, Lorde released her debut single "Royals". It became an international crossover hit and made Lorde
        the youngest solo artist (and the only New Zealander) to achieve a US number-one single on the <i>Billboard</i>
        Hot 100 since 1987. In late 2013, she released her debut studio album, <i>Pure Heroine</i>. The record topped
        the charts of New Zealand and Australia and reached number three on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200. Its following
        singles include "Tennis Court", "Team", "No Better" and "Glory and Gore". In 2014, Lorde released "Yellow
        Flicker Beat" as a single from the soundtrack for <i>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay &#8211; Part 1</i>.</p>
    <p>Lorde's music consists of subgenres such as dream pop and indietronica. She has earned two Grammy Awards, a Brit
        Award and ten New Zealand Music Awards. In 2013, she was named among <i>Time</i>'s most influential
        teenagers in the world, and in the following year, she was in <i>Forbes</i>'s "30 Under 30" list.

    <h2>Life and career</h2>
    <h3>1996&#8211;2008: Early life</h3>
    <p>Of Croatian and Irish descent, Ella Yelich-O'Connor was born in Takapuna to Vic O'Connor, a civil engineer, and
        <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonja_Yelich'>Sonja Yelich</a> (Croatian: <i>Sonja Jeli&#263;</i>),
        a poet, on 7 November 1996. She was raised in the nearby suburb of Devonport with her two sisters, Jerry and
        India, and her brother, Angelo.</p>
    <p>At age five, she joined a drama group and developed public speaking skills. At that same time, Lorde was
        attending <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Vauxhall_School'>Vauxhall School</a> and later Belmont
        Intermediate School. Her mother encouraged her to read a range of genres, which Lorde cited as a lyrical
        influence, "I guess my mum influenced my lyrical style by always buying me books. She'd give me a mixture of kid
        and adult books too, there weren't really any books I wasn't allowed to read. I remember reading <i>Feed</i> by
        M.T. Anderson when I was six, and her giving me Salinger and Carver at a young age, and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Frame'>Janet Frame</a> really young too."</p>
    <p>Lorde played netball at a young age alongside Vauxhall classmate Eliza McCartney, who later became an Olympic
        bronze medallist in the pole vault.</p>
    <h3>2009&#8211;11: Career beginnings</h3>

    <p>In May 2009, Lorde and musician friend Louis McDonald won the <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Intermediate_School'>Belmont Intermediate School</a>
        annual talent show as a duo. On August 13, 2009, Lorde and McDonald were invited in for a chat on Jim Mora's <i>Afternoons</i>
        show on Radio New Zealand. There, they performed covers of Pixie Lott's "Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)" and Kings of
        Leon's "Use Somebody". McDonald's father Ian sent both his home audio recording of her and Louis McDonald
        covering Duffy's song "Warwick Avenue" and his home video recording of the pair singing Pixie Lott's "Mama Do"
        to Universal Music Group (UMG)'s A&amp;R Scott Maclachlan. In 2009 Maclachlan signed her to UMG for development.
        Lorde was also part of the Belmont Intermediate School band Extreme; the band placed third in the North Shore
        Battle of the Bands finals at the Bruce Mason Centre, Takapuna, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland'
        >Auckland</a> on 18 November 2009.
    </p>
    <p>In 2010 Lorde and McDonald performed covers live on a regular basis as a duet called "Ella &amp; Louis", playing
        at The Leigh Sawmill Cafe on 15 August, at Roasted Addiqtion Cafe in Kingsland on 20 August, at <i>The Vic
            Unplugged</i> at Victoria Theatre, Devonport on 27 October, and at Devonstock in Devonport on 12 December.
        While working on her music career, she attended <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Takapuna_Grammar_School'
        >Takapuna Grammar School</a> from 2010 to 2013,
        completing Year Twelve. She later chose not to return in 2014 to finish Year Thirteen.</p>
    <p>In 2011, UMG hired vocal coach <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Dickinson'>Frances
        Dickinson</a> to give Lorde singing lessons twice a week for a year. During this time, she began writing songs
        and was set up with a succession of songwriters, but without success. At the age of fourteen, Lorde started
        reading short fiction and learned how to "put words together". She performed her own original songs publicly for
        the first time at <i>The Vic Unplugged II</i> on the Devonport Victoria Theatre main stage on 16 November 2011.
        In December 2011, MacLachlan paired Lorde with Joel Little, a songwriter, record producer, and former <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodnight_Nurse'>Goodnight Nurse</a> lead singer. The pair
        recorded five songs for an EP at Little's Golden Age Studios in Morningside, Auckland, and finished within three
        weeks.</p>
    <h3>2012&#8211;present: <i>Pure Heroine</i> and <i>The Hunger Games</i> soundtrack
    </h3>

    <p>In November 2012, Lorde self-released the record, entitled <i>The Love Club EP</i>, through her <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundCloud'>SoundCloud</a> account for free download. After being
        freely downloaded 60,000 times, UMG decided to commercially release the EP for sales in March 2013. The EP
        peaked at number two on the record charts of New Zealand and Australia. In June of that year, "Royals" was
        released as a single from the EP. The single became a crossover hit, peaking atop the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot
        100 for nine consecutive weeks. Consequently, Lorde became the youngest solo artist to achieve a number-one
        single in the US with "Royals", since Tiffany's "I Think We're Alone Now" (1987). The track eventually won the
        2013 APRA Silver Scroll Award, and two <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards'>Grammy
            Awards</a> for Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year at the 2014 Grammy Awards.</p>
    <p>In September 2013, Lorde released her debut studio album, <i>Pure Heroine</i>. The album topped the charts of New
        Zealand and Australia and reached the top five of several national charts, including Canada, Ireland, Norway and
        the United Kingdom. In the U.S., <i>Pure Heroine</i> peaked at number three on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and had
        sold 1.33 million copies by 2014. Worldwide, <i>Pure Heroine</i> had sold 1.5 million copies by the end of 2013.
        The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.</p>
    <p>The release of <i>Pure Heroine</i> was preceded by four singles: "Tennis Court" was released in June 2013,
        topping the New Zealand Singles Chart; the third single, "Team", became a top-ten hit worldwide; and "No
        Better", a song only included on the extended version of <i>Pure Heroine</i>, and "Glory and Gore" were released
        as the two final singles from the record, respectively. In September 2013, Lorde's cover version of the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_for_Fears'>Tears for Fears</a> single "Everybody Wants
        to Rule the World", produced by <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Levine'>Michael A.
            Levine</a> and Lucas Cantor, was included on <i>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</i> film soundtrack.</p>
    <p>In November 2013, Lorde signed a publishing deal with Songs Music Publishing, worth a reported US$2.5 million,
        after a bidding war between various companies, including <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Music_Entertainment'>Sony Music Entertainment</a> and her
        label UMG. The agreement gives the publisher the right to license Lorde's music for films and advertising. Late
        that year, she started a relationship with photographer James Lowe.</p>

    <p>In December 2013, Lorde announced that she had begun writing material for her second studio album. In June 2014,
        Lorde said that her second studio album was in its early stages and that, so far, it was "totally different"
        from her debut album. In the first half of 2014, Lorde headlined various festivals, including the Laneway
        Festival in Sydney, Australia, the three South American editions of Lollapalooza&#8212;Chile, Santiago; Buenos
        Aires, Argentina; and S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil&#8212;and the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachella_Festival'
        >Coachella Festival</a> in California.
    </p>
    <p>To promote <i>The Love Club EP</i> and <i>Pure Heroine</i>, Lorde embarked on an international tour, the first
        leg of which was held in North America in early 2014. She later announced the Australian leg, held in July, and
        the second North American leg, held in August. In April of that year, Lorde performed "All Apologies" with the
        surviving members of Nirvana during the band's induction ceremony at the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame.</p>
    <p>On 1 August 2014, Lorde performed at <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollapalooza'>Lollapalooza</a>
        again in Grant Park, Chicago. Lorde's set was critically well received, with <i>Billboard</i> selecting it as
        the fifth-best performance of the festival, while <i>Rolling Stone</i> deemed it the best segment of the Chicago
        event.</p>
    <p>On 29 September 2014, Lorde released "Yellow Flicker Beat" as the first single from the soundtrack album for the
        film <i>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay &#8212; Part 1</i>; Lorde oversaw the collation of the album's content, in
        addition to contributing vocals to several songs. By her 18th birthday in November 2014, it was estimated that
        Lorde was worth NZ$11 million. In 2015, Lorde was featured on "Magnets", a track on Disclosure's
        second studio album <i>Caracal</i>. At the 2016 Brit Awards, Lorde gave a performance of "Life on Mars" in
        tribute to the late English singer David Bowie.</p>

    <h2>Artistry</h2>
    <h3>Influences</h3>
    <p>Lorde grew up listening to American jazz musician Billie Holiday, and soul musicians Sam Cooke, <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Etta_James'>Etta James</a> and Otis Redding, whose music Lorde
        admires for "harvesting their suffering." Additionally, she listened to her parents' favourite records by the
        likes of Cat Stevens, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young'>Neil Young</a> and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac'>Fleetwood Mac</a> in her early years. Among
        those records, Lorde deemed <i>Rumours</i> by Fleetwood Mac as "a perfect record". She cites the unusual vocals
        of Grimes, band Sleigh Bells and producer <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/SBTRKT'>SBTRKT</a> as her
        prominent influences. Furthermore, Lorde names <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Yorke'>Thom
            Yorke</a> as an influence for his "smart" way of using his voice, as well as <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicki_Minaj'>Nicki Minaj</a> and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar'>Kendrick Lamar</a> for their "sassy" tone.
        Other inspirations for Lorde include Lady Gaga, Lana Del Rey, Grace Jones, James Blake, Yeasayer, Animal
        Collective, Bon Iver, Radiohead, Jamie Woon, Arcade Fire, Kurt Vonnegut, Laurie Anderson, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West'>Kanye West</a> and Prince.</p>
    <p>She cites rapper <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole'>J. Cole</a> and electronic producers as
        influences, saying that she was impressed by "their vocals in a really interesting way, whether it might be
        chopping up a vocal part or really lash or layering a vocal". Katy Perry, Justin Timberlake, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Mars'>Bruno Mars</a> and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Bareilles'>Sara Bareilles</a> have also influenced Lorde
        vocally. Lorde also states that she was inspired by the initially hidden identities of Burial and The Weeknd,
        explaining, "I feel like mystery is more interesting". She names her mother, a poet, as the main influence for
        her songwriting. In addition, Lorde names several authors including Raymond Carver, Wells Tower, Tobias Wolff,
        Claire Vaye Watkins, Sylvia Plath, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman'>Walt Whitman</a>
        and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/T._S._Eliot'>T. S. Eliot</a> as lyrical inspirations &#8211;
        particularly noting their sentence structures.</p>
    <h3>Musical style</h3>
    <p>Lorde's music has been described as art pop, dream pop, indie pop, electropop, and indie-electro. Multiple
        reviewers also note the influences of hip hop and R&amp;B on Lorde's releases. In a review for Consequence of
        Sound, Jon Hadusek details the minimal production on Lorde's music "allows [her] to sing any melody she wants,
        layering them over one another to create a choral effect". Jason Lipshutz of <i>Billboard</i> shares that her
        works features deep bass rumbles, lilting loops and programmed beats. <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lester'>Paul Lester</a> from <i>The Guardian</i> compares
        Lorde's music to that of Sky Ferreira, Lana Del Rey, Grimes and Eliza Doolittle.</p>
    <p>Lorde is an alto; however, on "Royals", she performs with a mezzo-soprano vocal range. Lorde writes her music
        vocally and does not play musical instruments on her records or onstage. She states that her main focus is her
        voice, elaborating, "I don't play any instruments, so my voice needs to have the focus. My vocal-scape is really
        important." PopMatters's Evan Sawdey describes Lorde's vocals as being "unique and powerfully intriguing". Jason
        Lipshutz of <i>Billboard</i> praises her vocals for being "dynamic, smoky and restrained". Lester characterises
        Lorde's vocals as "sweet, sultry and sour", while James Lachno from <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> details the
        singer's voice as "twitchy electro". In an article for <i>The AV Club</i>, Kevin McFarland writes that
        "[Lorde's] voice is the alpha and omega of her talent. She has the presence and vocal development of singers
        more than twice her age. Her voice isn't booming or overpowering, but rather mystifying and alluring, both
        floating on its own in a sea of reverb and digital blips and awash in an army of chorused overdubs."</p>
    <h3>Songwriting and lyrics</h3>
    <p>Talking about her collaboration with Joel Little, Lorde shares that Little's refining her "raw potential to end
        up with [the music]" was one of the best aspects of him. She also views Little as "the only one who was working
        with electronic music in the way [she] was interested in at the time". Lorde details that her songs are shaped
        by her lyrics, which she felt as a "more cohesive way of working." She said, "I tend to start with lyrics
        &#8211; sometimes the seed of a song will just be a word that I thought was rad, one that summed up a particular
        idea I'd been trying to pin down." Nonetheless, she points out that the songwriting process of "Tennis Court"
        was different to how she normally writes a song: the lyrics are built on the instant music and beat.</p>
    <p>The lyrical content of her two first major releases, <i>The Love Club EP</i> and <i>Pure Heroine</i>, criticises
        mainstream popular culture. Lindsay Zoladz from <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_Media'>Pitchfork
            Media</a> noted that Lorde expressed her indifference towards modern-day's culture, further explaining that
        "Lorde has introduced herself to the world as someone who gives very few fucks." On behalf of <i>Rolling
            Stone</i>, critic Jonah Weiner also noted the typical themes of teen pop music, including "social anxiety,
        romantic yearning, debilitating ennui [and] booze-soaked ragers". Jim Pickney from the <i>New Zealand
            Listener</i> writes that Lorde's lyrics are structured in a short story manner and praised that her
        songwriting ability "combines unmistakably teenage confusion, curiosity and confidence with word skills beyond
        her years."</p>
    <h2>Public image</h2>

    <p>Lorde chose her stage name because she was fascinated with "royals and aristocracy". However, she felt the name
        <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord'>Lord</a> was too masculine, thus she added an "e" to make it
        more feminine. She described her public image as coming "naturally" to her. Her music is noted for the manner in
        which its view of pop culture is contrasted with that of her contemporaries, such as <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Miley_Cyrus'>Miley Cyrus</a> and Rihanna. Lorde is a
        self-identified feminist.</p>
    <p>In a November 2013 interview with <i>Q</i>, Lorde expressed frustration about "certain things about music":
        "There are a lot of shock tactics these days. People trying to outdo each other, which will probably culminate
        in two people fucking on stage at the Grammys." Following the release of <i>Pure Heroine</i>, she also described
        herself as a "sex-positive" person, elaborating:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>People like to paint me in a certain way, but I'm a hugely sex-positive person and I have nothing against
            anyone getting naked. For me personally I just don't think it really would complement my music in any way or
            help me tell a story any better. It's not like I have a problem with dancing around in undies&#8212;I think
            you can use that stuff in a hugely powerful way. It just hasn't felt necessary for me.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In November 2013, Lorde was included in <i>Time</i>'s list of the most influential teenagers in the
        world, with Mark Metcalfe from the publication commenting that she was "forging her own path". In January 2014,
        <i>Forbes</i> placed Lorde on their "30 Under 30" list of young people "who are changing our world". She was the
        youngest individual to be featured on the list. In October of that year, Lorde was included in the list "The 25
        Most Influential Teens of 2014" by <i>Time</i>. Featuring Lorde in its 6 September 2013 cover story, <i>Billboard</i>
        named Lorde "your new alt-rock heroine". <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears'>Britney
            Spears</a> is an admirer of Lorde, commenting that her music "[is] really different and cool."</p>
    <p>In June 2014, Lorde released a two-piece make-up limited edition collection in collaboration with MAC Cosmetics,
        consisting of a lipstick titled after her debut album, <i>Pure Heroine</i>, and an eyeliner. She filmed a video
        for the Electoral Commission to encourage voter turnout of young people at the 2014 New Zealand general
        election, despite being too young to vote at the time. On 13 May 2015, a wax figure of Lorde was introduced to
        the Madame Tussauds Hollywood.</p>
    <p>Her career and the influence of the music industry were parodied in the episodes &#8243;The Cissy&#8243; and
        "#REHASH" of <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park'>South Park</a> (season 18, episode 3 and
        9; broadcast in October and December of 2014). That role was also used in other episode of the same season.</p>
