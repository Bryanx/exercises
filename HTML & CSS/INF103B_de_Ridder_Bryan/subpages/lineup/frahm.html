    <p><b>Nils Frahm</b> (born 20 September 1982) is a German musician, composer and record producer based in
        Berlin. He is known for combining classical and electronic music and for an unconventional approach to the
        piano in which he mixes a grand piano, upright piano, Roland Juno-60, Rhodes piano, drum machine, and Moog
        Taurus.</p>
    <p>As well as his solo work, Frahm has released collaborations with such notable performers as Anne M&#252;ller,
        &#211;lafur Arnalds, and F. S. Blumm. Together with Frederic Gmeiner and Sebastian Singwald he records and
        performs as Nonkeen.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Frahm had an early introduction to music. His father, Klaus Frahm, was a photographer who also designed
        covers for ECM Records. He grew up near Hamburg, where he learned the styles of the classical pianists as
        well as contemporary composers.</p>
    <p>Frahm's earlier solo piano works <i>Wintermusik</i> (2009) and <i>The Bells</i> (2009) gained him attention,
        but it was his 2011 release <i>Felt</i> that was met with critical acclaim. It was his first studio album on
        Erased Tapes, which has been releasing his music since. The album was followed by the solo synthesiser EP
        <i>Juno</i> and by <i>Screws</i> (2012), recorded while Frahm was recovering from a thumb injury, and
        offered as a free download to fans on his birthday. His follow-up to <i>Juno</i>, titled <i>Juno
            Reworked</i> (2013), featured guest reworks by <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Abbott'
        >Luke Abbott</a> and Chris Clark.</p>
    <p>Frahm's album, <i>Spaces</i> (2013), was made of live recordings from various venues spanning over two years.
    </p>
    <p>In December 2013, Frahm released his first music book, <i>Eins</i>, published by Manners McDade.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Frahm announced his new piano UNA CORDA, specially designed and made for him by David Klavins. The
        piano weighs under 100&#160;kg and has one string per key, rather than the commonly used three strings. His
        album <i>Solo</i> (2015), an improvisation single take without any overdubs, was later recorded on the
        piano. It was one of the 19 records nominated for the IMPALA Album of the Year Award.</p>
    <p>A condensed version of his single "More" was featured in the
        <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin'>Assassin's Creed Unity</a> unity gamescom trailer.</p>
    <p>In February 2016 Nonkeen released <i>The Gamble</i>, followed by its companion release <i>Oddments of the
        Gamble</i> in August 2016. Pitchfork.com described the album "as charmingly patched together and messy as it
        is well-paced and dynamic". The material was recorded over eight years while the artwork was produced by
        Frahm's father.</p>
