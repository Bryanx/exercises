    <p><b>Radiohead</b> are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Yorke'>Thom Yorke</a> (lead vocals, guitar, piano,
        keyboards), <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Greenwood'>Jonny Greenwood</a> (lead guitar,
        keyboards, other instruments), <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_O'>Ed O'Brien</a>
        (guitar, backing vocals), <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Greenwood'>Colin Greenwood</a>
        (bass), and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Selway'>Phil Selway</a> (drums, percussion,
        backing vocals). They have worked with producer <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Godrich'>Nigel
            Godrich</a> and cover artist <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Donwood'>Stanley
            Donwood</a> since 1994.</p>
    <p>After signing to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/EMI'>EMI</a> in 1991, Radiohead released their
        debut single "Creep" in 1992. It became a worldwide hit after the release of their debut album, <i>Pablo
            Honey</i> (1993). Their popularity and critical standing rose in the United Kingdom with the release of
        their second album, <i>The Bends</i> (1995). Radiohead's third album, <i>OK Computer</i> (1997), propelled
        them to international fame; with an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, it is often acclaimed
        as a landmark record of the 1990s and one of the best albums of all time. The group's next albums <i>Kid
            A</i> (2000) and <i>Amnesiac</i> (2001), recorded simultaneously, marked a dramatic change in style,
        incorporating influences from experimental electronic music, 20th-century classical music, krautrock, and
        jazz. Despite initially dividing listeners, <i>Kid A</i> was later named the best album of the decade by <i>Rolling
            Stone</i>, Pitchfork and the <i>Times.</i></p>
    <p>Radiohead's sixth album, <i>Hail to the Thief</i> (2003), mixed rock and electronic music with lyrics
        inspired by the War on Terror, and was the band's final album for EMI. Their subsequent releases have
        pioneered alternative release platforms such as pay-what-you-want and BitTorrent. Radiohead self-released
        their seventh album, <i>In Rainbows</i> (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price,
        to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, <i>The King of Limbs</i> (2011), an exploration of
        rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. Their ninth album, <i>A Moon Shaped Pool</i>
        (2016), prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements.</p>
    <p>Radiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their work places highly in both listener polls
        and critics' lists of the best music of the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, they were ranked 73rd in <i>Rolling
            Stone</i>'s list of "The Greatest Artists of All Time"; Jonny Greenwood (48th) and O'Brien were both
        included in <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s list of greatest guitarists, and Yorke (66th) in their list
        of greatest singers. In 2009, <i>Rolling Stone</i> readers voted the group the second-best artist of the
        2000s.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>1985&#8211;92: Formation and first years</h3>

    <p>The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon,
        Oxfordshire. Guitarist and singer Thom Yorke and bassist Colin Greenwood were in the same year, guitarist Ed
        O'Brien and drummer Phil Selway the year above, and multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, brother of Colin,
        two years below. In 1985, they formed On a Friday, the name referring to the band's usual rehearsal day in
        the school's music room. Jonny was the last to join, first on harmonica and then keyboards, but soon became
        the lead guitarist; he had previously been in another band, Illiterate Hands, with musician <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Powell'>Nigel Powell</a> and Yorke's brother Andy
        Yorke. According to Colin, the band members picked their respective instruments because they wanted to play
        music together, rather than through an interest in the particular instrument: "It was more of a collective
        angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool."
        At one point, On a Friday featured a saxophone section.</p>
    <p>The band disliked the school's strict atmosphere&#8212;the headmaster once charged the band for using a
        rehearsal room on a Sunday&#8212;and found solace in the school's music department. They credited their
        music teacher for introducing them to jazz, film scores, postwar avant-garde music, and 20th-century
        classical music. <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire'>Oxfordshire</a> and the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Valley'>Thames Valley</a> had an active independent
        music scene in the late 1980s, but it centred on shoegazing bands such as Ride and Slowdive.</p>

    <p>Although all but Jonny had left Abingdon by 1987 to attend university, On a Friday continued to rehearse on
        weekends and holidays. At the University of Exeter, Yorke played with the band Headless Chickens, performing
        songs including future Radiohead material, and met artist Stanley Donwood, who would later create artwork
        for the band. In 1991, On a Friday regrouped, sharing a house on the corner of Magdalen Road and Ridgefield
        Road, Oxford.</p>
    <p>As On a Friday continued to perform in Oxford, including more performances at the Jericho Tavern, record
        labels and producers became interested. Chris Hufford, Slowdive's producer and co-owner of Oxford's
        Courtyard Studios, attended an early On a Friday concert at the Jericho Tavern. Impressed, he and his
        partner Bryce Edge produced a demo tape and became On a Friday's managers; they remain Radiohead's managers
        today. In late 1991, after a chance meeting between Colin and EMI A&amp;R representative Keith Wozencroft at
        Our Price, the record shop where Colin worked, On a Friday band signed a six-album recording contract with
        EMI. At the label's request, the band changed their name; "Radiohead" was taken from the song "Radio Head"
        on the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads'>Talking Heads</a> album <i>True
            Stories</i> (1986).</p>
    <h3>1992&#8211;94: "Creep", <i>Pablo Honey</i> and early success
    </h3>
    <p>Radiohead recorded their debut release, the <i>Drill</i> EP, with Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge at Courtyard
        Studios. Released in May 1992, its chart performance was poor. The band enlisted Paul Kolderie and Sean
        Slade, who had worked with US indie bands <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies'>Pixies</a>
        and Dinosaur Jr., to produce their debut album, recorded quickly in an <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford'>Oxford</a> studio in 1992. With the release of the
        "Creep" single later that year, Radiohead began to receive attention in the British music press, not all of
        it favourable; <i>NME</i> described them as "a lily-livered excuse for a rock band", and "Creep" was
        blacklisted by <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC'>BBC</a> Radio 1 because it was deemed "too
        depressing".</p>
    <p>Radiohead released their debut album, <i>Pablo Honey</i>, in February 1993. It stalled at number 22 in the UK
        charts, as "Creep" and its follow-up singles "Anyone Can Play Guitar" and "Stop Whispering" failed to become
        hits. "Pop Is Dead", a non-album single, also sold poorly. Some critics compared the band's early style to
        the wave of grunge music popular in the early 1990s, dubbing them "Nirvana-lite", and <i>Pablo Honey</i>
        failed to make a critical or a commercial splash upon its initial release. Despite shared influences with
        popular guitar acts, and some notice for Yorke's falsetto, Radiohead toured only British universities and
        clubs.</p>
    <p>In early 1993, Radiohead began to attract listeners elsewhere. "Creep" had been played frequently on Israeli
        radio by influential DJ Yoav Kutner, and in March, after the song became a hit in that country, Radiohead
        were invited to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv'>Tel Aviv</a> for their first live gig
        overseas. Around the same time, the San Francisco alternative radio station <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/KITS'>KITS</a> added "Creep" to its playlist. Soon other
        radio stations along the west coast of the United States followed suit. By the time Radiohead began their
        first North American tour in June 1993, the music video for "Creep" was in heavy rotation on MTV. The song
        rose to number two on the US modern rock chart, entered the lower reaches of the top 40 pop chart, and hit
        number seven in the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart'>UK Singles Chart</a> when
        EMI rereleased it in the UK in September.</p>
    <p>Unexpected attention for the single in America prompted EMI to improvise new promotional plans, and the band
        shuttled back and forth between continents, playing more than 150 concerts in 1993. Radiohead nearly broke
        up due to the pressure of sudden success as the <i>Pablo Honey</i> supporting tour extended into its second
        year. The band members described the tour as difficult to adjust to, saying that towards its end they were
        "still playing the same songs that [they had] recorded two years previously&#160;... like being held in a
        time warp," when they were eager to work on new songs.</p>
    <h3>1994&#8211;95: <i>The Bends</i>, critical recognition and growing fanbase
    </h3>
    <p>Radiohead began work on their second album in 1994, hiring veteran <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Road_Studios'>Abbey Road Studios</a> producer John
        Leckie. Tensions were high, with mounting expectations to deliver a follow-up to match the success of
        "Creep". Recording felt unnatural in the studio, with the band having over-rehearsed the material. Seeking a
        change of scenery, they toured the Far East, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia'>Australasia</a>
        and Mexico and found greater confidence performing their new music live. However, troubled by the fame he
        had achieved, Yorke became disillusioned with being "at the sharp end of the sexy, sassy, MTV eye-candy
        lifestyle" he felt he was helping to sell to the world.</p>
    <p><i>My Iron Lung</i>, an EP and single released late in 1994, was Radiohead's reaction, marking a transition
        towards the greater depth they aimed for on their second album. It was their first time working with their
        future producer Nigel Godrich, then working under Leckie as an audio engineer. It was also Radiohead's first
        collaboration with artist Stanley Donwood, who has produced all of their artwork since. Promoted through
        alternative radio stations, <i>My Iron Lung</i>'s sales were better than expected, and suggested for the
        first time that the band had found a loyal fanbase and were not one-hit wonders.</p>
    <p>Having introduced more new songs on tour, Radiohead finished recording their second album by year's end, and
        released <i>The Bends</i> in March 1995. The album was driven by dense riffs and ethereal atmospheres from
        the band's three guitarists, with greater use of keyboards than their debut. It received stronger reviews
        for its songwriting and performances. While Radiohead were seen as outsiders to the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Britpop'>Britpop</a> scene that dominated media attention
        at the time, they were finally successful in their home country with <i>The Bends</i>, as singles "Fake
        Plastic Trees", "High and Dry", "Just", and "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" made their way to UK chart success;
        the latter song placed Radiohead in the top five for the first time. In 1995, Radiohead again toured North
        America and Europe, this time in support of R.E.M., one of their formative influences and at the time one of
        the biggest rock bands in the world. The buzz generated by such famous fans as R.E.M singer Michael Stipe,
        along with distinctive music videos for "Just" and "Street Spirit", helped to sustain Radiohead's popularity
        outside the UK.</p>
    <p>"High and Dry" became a modest hit, but Radiohead's growing fanbase was insufficient to repeat the worldwide
        success of "Creep". <i>The Bends</i> peaked at 88 on the US album charts, which remains Radiohead's lowest
        showing there. Nonetheless, Radiohead were satisfied with the album's reception. Jonny Greenwood later said:
        "I think the turning point for us came about nine or twelve months after <i>The Bends</i> was released and
        it started appearing in people's [best of] polls for the end of the year. That's when it started to feel
        like we made the right choice about being a band." In later years, <i>The Bends</i> appeared in many
        publications' lists of the best albums of all time, including <i>Rolling Stone's</i> 2012 edition of the
        "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" at #111.</p>
    <h3>1995&#8211;98: <i>OK Computer</i> and critical acclaim
    </h3>
    <p>By late 1995, Radiohead had already recorded one song that would appear on their next record. "Lucky",
        released as a single to promote the War Child charity's <i>The Help Album</i>, was recorded in a brief
        session with Nigel Godrich, the young audio engineer who had assisted on <i>The Bends</i> and produced a
        1996 B-side, "Talk Show Host". The band decided to self-produce their next album with Godrich's assistance,
        and began work in early 1996. By July they had recorded four songs at their rehearsal studio, Canned
        Applause, a converted apple shed in the countryside near Didcot, Oxfordshire.</p>

    <p>In August 1996, Radiohead toured as the opening act for Alanis Morissette. They resumed recording, not at a
        traditional music studio, but instead at St. Catherine's Court, a 15th-century mansion near Bath. The
        sessions were relaxed, with the band playing at all hours of the day, recording songs in different rooms,
        and listening to the Beatles, DJ Shadow, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennio_Morricone'>Ennio
            Morricone</a> and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis'>Miles Davis</a> for inspiration.
        Radiohead contributed "Talk Show Host" and the newly recorded "Exit Music (For a Film)" to Baz Luhrmann's
        adaptation of <i>Romeo + Juliet</i> (1996) late in the year. Most of the rest of the album was complete by
        the end of 1996, and by March 1997, the record was mixed and mastered.</p>
    <p>Radiohead released their third album, <i>OK Computer</i>, in June 1997. The album found the band
        experimenting with song structures and incorporating ambient, avant garde and electronic influences,
        prompting <i>Rolling Stone</i> to call the album a "stunning art-rock tour de force". Radiohead denied being
        part of the progressive rock genre, but critics in the mid-90s began to compare their work to Pink Floyd, a
        band whose early 1970s work influenced Greenwood's guitar parts at the time. Some compared <i>OK
            Computer</i> thematically to Floyd's best-seller <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i> (1973), although Yorke
        said the album's lyrics had been inspired by observing the "speed" of the world in the 1990s. Yorke's
        lyrics, embodying different characters, had expressed what one magazine called "end-of-the-millennium blues"
        in contrast to the more personal songs of <i>The Bends</i>. According to journalist Alex Ross, the band had
        become "the poster boys for a certain kind of knowing alienation&#8212;as the Talking Heads and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M.'>R.E.M.</a> had been before." <i>OK Computer</i>
        met with critical acclaim. Yorke said he was "amazed it got the reaction it did. None of us fucking knew any
        more whether it was good or bad. What really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things,
        all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create."</p>
    <p><i>OK Computer</i> was the band's first number one UK chart debut, propelling them to commercial success
        around the world. Despite peaking at number 21 in the US charts, the album eventually met with mainstream
        recognition there, receiving the first <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards'>Grammy
            Awards</a> recognition of the band's career, a win for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album
        of
        the Year. "Paranoid Android", "Karma Police" and "No Surprises" were released as singles from the album, of
        which "Karma Police" was most successful internationally. In the same year, Radiohead became one of the
        first bands in the world to have a website, and developed a devoted online following; within a few years,
        there were dozens of fan sites devoted to the band.</p>
    <p>The release of <i>OK Computer</i> was followed by the year-long "Against Demons" world tour. Grant Gee, the
        director of the "No Surprises" video, accompanied and filmed the band, releasing the footage in the 1999
        documentary <i>Meeting People Is Easy</i>. The film portrays the band's disaffection with the music industry
        and press, showing their burnout over the course of the tour. The film also documents early versions of
        songs that were not released or were not released until years later, such as "How to Disappear Completely",
        "Life in a Glasshouse", "I Will" and "Nude". The film was screened at festivals such as the 1999 <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Film_Festival'>Maryland Film Festival</a> and had
        a limited theatrical release in select cities. During this time the band also released a music video
        compilation, <i>7 Television Commercials</i>, as well as two EPs, <i>Airbag/How Am I Driving?</i> and <i>No
            Surprises/Running from Demons</i>, that compiled their B-sides from <i>OK Computer</i> singles.</p>
    <h3>1998&#8211;2002: <i>Kid A</i>, <i>Amnesiac</i> and change in sound
    </h3>

    <p>Radiohead were largely inactive following their 1997&#8211;1998 tour; after its end, their only public
        performance in 1998 was at an <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International'>Amnesty
            International</a> concert in Paris. Yorke later said that during that period the band came close to
        splitting up, and that he had developed severe depression. In early 1999, Radiohead began work on a
        follow-up to <i>OK Computer</i>. Although the album's success meant there was no longer any pressure or a
        deadline from their record label, tension during this period was high. Band members all had different
        visions for Radiohead's future, and Yorke experienced writer's block, influencing him toward a more
        abstract, fragmented form of songwriting. Radiohead secluded themselves with producer Nigel Godrich in
        studios in Paris, Copenhagen, and Gloucester, and in their newly completed studio in Oxford. Eventually, all
        the members agreed on a new musical direction, redefining their instrumental roles. After nearly 18 months,
        Radiohead's recording sessions were completed in April 2000.</p>
    <p>In October 2000 Radiohead released their fourth album, <i>Kid A</i>, the first of two albums from these
        recording sessions. A departure from <i>OK Computer</i>, <i>Kid A</i> featured a minimalist and textured
        style with more diverse instrumentation, including the ondes Martenot, programmed electronic beats, strings,
        and jazz horns. It debuted at number one in many countries, including the US, where its debut atop the <i>Billboard</i>
        chart marked a first for the band, and the first US number one album by any UK act since the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_Girls'>Spice Girls</a> in 1996. This success was
        attributed variously to marketing, to the album's leak on the file-sharing network <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster'>Napster</a> a few months before its release, and
        to advance anticipation based, in part, on the success of <i>OK Computer</i>. Although Radiohead did not
        release any singles from <i>Kid A</i>, promos of "Optimistic" and "Idioteque" received radio play, and a
        series of "blips", or short videos set to portions of tracks, were played on music channels and released
        freely on the internet. The band had read Naomi Klein's anti-globalisation book <i>No Logo</i> during the
        recording, and decided to continue a summer 2000 tour of Europe later in the year in a custom-built tent
        free of advertising; they also promoted <i>Kid A</i> with three sold-out North American theatre concerts.

    <p><i>Kid A</i> received a <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award'>Grammy Award</a> for Best
        Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in
        independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some mainstream British critics saw
        <i>Kid A</i> as a "commercial suicide note", labelling it "intentionally difficult" and longing for a return
        to the band's earlier style. Radiohead's fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or
        mystified, there were many who saw the album as the band's best work. Yorke, however, denied that Radiohead
        had set out to eschew commercial expectations, saying: "I was really, really amazed at how badly [<i>Kid
            A</i>] was being viewed&#160;... because the music's not that hard to grasp. We're not trying to be
        difficult&#160;... We're actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss
        off a lot of people&#160;... What we're doing isn't that radical." The album has since been ranked one of
        the best of all time by publications including <i>Time</i> and <i>Rolling Stone;</i> Pitchfork, the
        <i>Times</i> and <i>Rolling Stone</i> named it the best album of the decade.</p>
    <p>Radiohead's fifth album, <i>Amnesiac</i>, was released in June 2001. It comprised additional tracks from the
        <i>Kid A</i> recording sessions, plus one track recorded after <i>Kid A</i>'s release, "Life in a
        Glasshouse", featuring the Humphrey Lyttelton Band. Radiohead stressed that they saw <i>Amnesiac</i> not as
        a collection of B-sides or "leftovers" from <i>Kid A</i> but an album in its own right. It topped the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Albums_Chart'>UK Albums Chart</a> and reached number
        two in the US, being nominated for a Grammy Award and the Mercury Music Prize. Radiohead embarked on a world
        tour, visiting North America, Europe and Japan. "Pyramid Song" and "Knives Out", Radiohead's first singles
        since 1998, were modestly successful. A live album, <i>I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings</i>, released in
        November 2001, features performances of seven songs from <i>Kid A</i> and <i>Amnesiac,</i> and the
        previously unreleased acoustic track "True Love Waits".</p>
    <h3>2002&#8211;04: <i>Hail to the Thief</i> and departure from EMI
    </h3>
    <p>In July and August 2002, Radiohead toured Portugal and Spain, playing a number of new songs. They recorded
        the new material in two weeks in a Los Angeles studio with Godrich, adding several tracks later in Oxford,
        where they continued their work into the next year. The band described the recording process as relaxed, in
        contrast to the tense sessions for <i>Kid A</i> and <i>Amnesiac</i>.</p>
    <p>Radiohead's sixth album, <i>Hail to the Thief</i>, was released in June 2003, combining guitar rock with
        electronic music. Its lyrics were influenced by what Yorke called "the general sense of ignorance and
        intolerance and panic and stupidity" following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush. The album
        debuted at number one in the UK and number three on the <i>Billboard</i> chart, and was eventually certified
        platinum in the UK and gold in the US. The singles "There There", "Go to Sleep" and "2 + 2 = 5" achieved
        heavy circulation on modern rock radio. At the 2003 Grammy Awards, Radiohead were again nominated for Best
        Alternative Album, and producer Godrich and engineer Darrell Thorp received the Grammy Award for Best
        Engineered Album. In May 2003, Radiohead embarked in on a world tour and headlined Glastonbury Festival. The
        tour finished in May 2004 with a performance at the Coachella Festival. A compilation of <i>Hail to the
            Thief</i> B-sides, remixes and live performances, <i>COM LAG (2plus2isfive)</i>, was released in April
        2004.</p>
    <p>Radiohead's six-album record contract with EMI ended with the release of <i>Hail to the Thief.</i> In 2005,
        Yorke told <i>Time</i>: "I like the people at our record company, but the time is at hand when you have to
        ask why anyone needs one. And, yes, it probably would give us some perverse pleasure to say 'Fuck you' to
        this decaying business model." In 2006, the <i>New York Times</i> described Radiohead as "by far the world's
        most popular unsigned band".</p>
    <h3>2004&#8211;09: Solo work, <i>In Rainbows</i> and "pay what you want"
    </h3>

    <p>Following the <i>Hail to the Thief</i> tour, Radiohead went on hiatus to spend time with their families and
        work on side projects. Jonny Greenwood composed soundtracks for the films <i>Bodysong</i> (2004) and <i>There
            Will Be Blood</i> (2007); the latter was the first of several collaborations between Greenwood and
        director Paul Thomas Anderson. In July 2006, Yorke released his debut solo album, <i>The Eraser,</i>
        comprosing mainly electronic music. He told Pitchfork: "I've been in the band since we left school and never
        dared do anything on my own ... It was like, 'Man, I've got to find out what it feels like,' you know?"</p>
    <p>Radiohead began work on their seventh album in February 2005 with no record label. In an effort to "get out
        of the comfort zone", they decided against involving producer Godrich, with whom they had recorded five
        albums, and hired producer Spike Stent. The collaboration with Stent was unsuccessful and ended in April
        2006. In September 2005, Radiohead recorded "I Want None of This" for the War Child charity album <i>Help: A
            Day in the Life</i>. The album was sold online, with "I Want None of This" the most downloaded track,
        though it was not released as a single. In late 2006, after touring Europe and North America with new
        material, the band resumed work with Godrich in London, Oxford and rural Somerset, England. Work was
        finished in June 2007 and the recordings were mastered the following month.</p>
    <p>Radiohead's seventh album, <i>In Rainbows</i>, was released through the band's website in October 2007 as a
        download for any amount users wanted, including &#163;0&#8212;a landmark use of the pay-what-you-want model
        for music sales. The pay-what-you-want release, the first for a major act, made headlines worldwide and
        sparked debate about the implications for the music industry. According to <i>Mojo</i>, the release was
        "hailed as a revolution in the way major bands sell their music", and the media's reaction was "almost
        overwhelmingly positive"; <i>Time</i> called it "easily the most important release in the recent history of
        the music business". 1.2&#160;million downloads were reportedly sold by the day of release, but the band's
        management did not release official sales figures, claiming that the internet-only distribution was intended
        to boost later retail sales. Colin Greenwood explained the internet release as a way of avoiding the
        "regulated playlists" and "straitened formats" of radio and TV, ensuring fans around the world could all
        experience the music at the same time, and preventing leaks in advance of a physical release. O'Brien said
        the self-release strategy sold fewer records, but made more money for the band as there was no middleman. A
        special "discbox" edition of <i>In Rainbows</i>, containing the record on vinyl, a hardcover book of
        artwork, and a second CD of extra songs, was also sold from Radiohead's website and shipped in late 2007.
    </p>
    <p><i>In Rainbows</i> was released physically in the UK in late December 2007 on <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/XL_Recordings'>XL Recordings</a> and in North America in
        January 2008 on TBD Records, charting at number one both in the UK and in the US. The record's retail
        success in the US &#8211; after having been legally available for months as a free download &#8211; was
        Radiohead's highest chart success in that country since <i>Kid A</i>, while it was their fifth UK number one
        album. <i>In Rainbows</i> sold more than three million copies within one year. The album received critical
        acclaim for its more accessible sound and personal lyrics. It was nominated for the short list of the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Music_Prize'>Mercury Music Prize</a> and went on
        to win the 2009 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. Their production team won the Grammy for Best
        Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package, while Radiohead received their third nomination for Album of the
        Year. Along with three other nominations for the band, Godrich's production and the "House of Cards" music
        video also received nominations.</p>
    <p>Radiohead released a number of singles from <i>In Rainbows</i>: "Jigsaw Falling into Place" in January 2008,
        followed by "Nude", which debuted at number 37 in the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, Radiohead's first song to
        make that chart since 1995's "High and Dry" and their first top 40 hit in the US since "Creep". In July they
        released a digitally-shot video for "House of Cards". "House of Cards", along with "Bodysnatchers", also
        received a single release on radio. In September the band announced a fourth single, "Reckoner", and a remix
        competition similar to one organised for "Nude". In April 2008, Radiohead launched W.A.S.T.E. Central, a
        social networking service for Radiohead fans.</p>

    <p>EMI released a greatest hits album, <i>Radiohead: The Best Of</i>, in June 2008. The compilation was made
        without Radiohead's input and only contains songs released under their recording contract with EMI. Yorke
        was critical of the release, saying: "There's nothing we can do about it. The work is really public property
        now anyway, in my head at least. It's a wasted opportunity in that if we'd been behind it, and we wanted to
        do it, then it might have been good." In August 2008, EMI reissued "special editions" of Radiohead's back
        catalogue as part of its "From the Capitol Vaults" series. From mid-2008 to early 2009, Radiohead toured
        North America, Europe, Japan and South America to promote <i>In Rainbows,</i> and headlined the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_and_Leeds_Festivals'>Reading and Leeds
            Festivals</a> in August 2009.</p>
    <h3>2009&#8211;12: <i>The King of Limbs</i>, two drummers and Toronto stage collapse
    </h3>
    <p>As social media began to expand around the turn of the decade, Radiohead gradually withdrew their public
        presence, with no promotional interviews or tours to promote new releases. Pitchfork wrote that around this
        time "their popularity became increasingly untethered from the typical formalities of record promotion,
        placing them on the same level as <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc&#233;'
        >Beyonc&#233;</a> and Kanye West."</p>
    <p>In May 2009, Radiohead began new recording sessions with Godrich. In August, they released "Harry Patch (In
        Memory Of)", a tribute song to Harry Patch, the last surviving British soldier to have fought in World War
        I, with proceeds donated to the British Legion. The song has no conventional rock instrumentation, and
        instead comprises Yorke's vocals and an string arrangement composed by Jonny Greenwood. Later that month,
        another new song, "These Are My Twisted Words", was leaked via torrent, possibly by Radiohead themselves.
        The song features krautrock-like drumming and guitars, and was released as a free download on the Radiohead
        website the following week. Commentators saw the releases as part of Radiohead's new unpredictable release
        strategy, without the need for traditional marketing campaigns.</p>
    <p>That year, Yorke formed a new band to perform <i>The Eraser</i> live, Atoms for Peace, with musicians
        including Godrich and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers'>Red Hot Chili
            Peppers</a> bassist Flea; the band played eight North American shows in 2010. In January 2010, Radiohead
        played their only full concert of the year in the Los Angeles <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda_Theater'>Henry Fonda Theater</a> as a benefit
        for Oxfam. Tickets were auctioned, raising over half a million US dollars for the NGO's <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake'>2010 Haiti earthquake</a> relief.
        In June, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed a surprise set at Glastonbury Festival, performing
        <i>Eraser</i> and Radiohead songs. On 30 August, Selway released his debut solo album, <i>Familial</i>. In
        December, a fan-made video of Radiohead's <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfam'>Oxfam</a>
        benefit performance was released via YouTube and torrent with Radiohead's support and a "pay-what-you-want"
        link to donate to Oxfam. In September 2010, Radiohead released the soundboard recording of their 2009 Prague
        performance for use in another fan-made concert video. The <i>Radiohead for Haiti</i> and <i>Live in
            Praha</i> videos were described as examples of the band's openness to fans and positivity toward
        non-commercial internet distribution.</p>

    <p>Radiohead finished recording their eighth album, <i>The King of Limbs</i>, in January 2011. Following the
        protracted recording and more conventional rock instrumentation of <i>In Rainbows</i> (2007), Radiohead
        developed <i>The King of Limbs</i> by sampling and looping their recordings with turntables while
        incorporating ambient sounds. According to O'Brien: "Rhythm is the king of limbs! The rhythm dictates the
        record. It's very important." The album was announced on <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine' s_Day'
        target='' />Valentine's Day</a> and self-released as a download on 18 February 2011 through the Radiohead
        website. It was followed by a retail release on CD and vinyl formats in March, and a special "newspaper
        album" edition in May.</p>
    <p><i>The King of Limbs</i> sold an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 copies through Radiohead's website; the retail
        edition debuted at number six on the United States <i>Billboard</i> 200 and number seven on the UK Albums
        Chart. It was nominated for five categories in the 54th Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Music Album, Best
        Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package, Best Short Form Music Video (for "Lotus Flower"), Best Rock
        Performance ("Lotus Flower") and Best Rock Song ("Lotus Flower"). Two tracks not included on <i>The King of
            Limbs</i> but worked on during the same sessions, "Supercollider" and "The Butcher", were released as a
        single for <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_Store_Day'>Record Store Day</a> on 16 April
        2011. A series of <i>King of Limbs</i> remixes by various artists were compiled on <i>TKOL RMX 1234567</i>,
        released in September 2011.</p>
    <p>To perform the rhythmically complex <i>King of Limbs</i> material live, Radiohead enlisted a second drummer,
        Clive Deamer, who had worked with Portishead and Get the Blessing; Selway said of the collaboration: "One
        played in the traditional way, the other almost mimicked a drum machine. It was push-and-pull, like kids at
        play, really interesting." With Deamer, Radiohead recorded a second <i>From the Basement</i> session,
        released as <i>The King of Limbs: Live from the Basement</i> in December 2011. The performance included two
        new songs, "The Daily Mail" and "Staircase", released as a double A-side download single on 19 December
        2011. Deamer has joined Radiohead on subsequent tours.</p>
    <p>On 24 June, Radiohead played a surprise performance on the Park stage at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival,
        performing songs from <i>The King of Limbs</i> before an audience for the first time. In September, they
        played two dates at New York City's <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseland_Ballroom'>Roseland
            Ballroom</a> and made American TV appearances including a one-hour special episode of <i>The Colbert
            Report</i> and the season premi&#232;re of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. In February 2012, they began
        their first extended North American tour in four years, including dates in the United States, Canada and
        Mexico. While on tour, Radiohead spent a day working on new material at Jack White's <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Man_Records'>Third Man Records</a> studio.</p>
    <p>On 16 June 2012, an hour before gates were due to open at Toronto's <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Downsview_Park'>Downsview Park</a> for the final concert of
        Radiohead's North American tour, the roof of the venue's temporary stage collapsed, killing drum technician
        Scott Johnson and injuring three other members of Radiohead's touring technical crew. The collapse also
        destroyed the band's light show and much of their musical equipment. No band members were on stage. The
        concert was cancelled and Radiohead's tour dates in Europe were postponed. After rescheduling the tour,
        Radiohead paid tribute to Johnson and their stage crew at their next concert, in N&#238;mes, France, in
        July. Yorke later wrote that finishing the tour after the collapse was his "biggest achievement so far". In
        June 2013, the Ontario Ministry of Labour charged <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Nation'>Live
            Nation</a> Canada Inc, Live Nation Ontario Concerts GP Inc, Optex Staging &amp; Services Inc and an
        engineer
        with 13 charges under the Occupational Health and Safety Act. The hearing began in November 2015.</p>
    <h3>2012&#8211;present: Hiatus, further solo work, and <i>A Moon Shaped Pool</i>
    </h3>
    <p>In 2012, EMI was bought by Universal Music. The <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission'
    >European Commission</a> approved the deal on
        the condition that Universal Music divest EMI's <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlophone'>Parlophone</a>
        label, which controlled the Radiohead albums recorded while the band were signed to EMI. In February 2013,
        Parlophone, along with Radiohead's back catalogue, was bought by <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Music_Group'>Warner Music Group</a> (WMG). As part
        of the purchase, WMG made an agreement with the trade group Impala to reach distribution agreements with
        independent labels for many of the Parlophone acts, which required artist approval. In October 2015,
        Radiohead sued Parlophone for deductions made from downloads of their back catalogue. In April 2016, as a
        result of the Impala agreement, WMG transferred Radiohead's back catalogue to XL Recordings, who had
        released the physical editions of <i>In Rainbows</i> and <i>The King of Limbs</i> and most of Yorke's solo
        work. The "special editions" of Radiohead albums, issued by EMI in 2008 without Radiohead's approval, were
        removed from streaming services. In May 2016, XL reissued Radiohead's back catalogue on vinyl.</p>
    <p>After the <i>King of Limbs</i> tour, during which the band performed several new songs, Radiohead entered
        hiatus again. In February 2013, Yorke and Godrich's band Atoms for Peace released a studio album,
        <i>Amok</i>. The pair made headlines that year for their criticism of the free music streaming service
        Spotify, which they believe cannot support new artists; Yorke accused <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify'>Spotify</a> of only benefiting major labels with
        large back catalogues, and encouraged artists to build their own "direct connections" with audiences
        instead. On 11 February 2014, Radiohead released the <i>Polyfauna</i> app for Android and iOS phones, an
        "experimental collaboration" between the band and the British digital arts studio Universal Everything which
        uses musical elements and imagery from <i>The King of Limbs</i>.</p>
    <p>Yorke and Selway released their respective second solo albums, <i>Tomorrow's Modern Boxes</i> and
        <i>Weatherhouse</i>,
        on 26 September and 7 October 2014. Jonny Greenwood scored his third film for Paul Thomas Anderson, <i>Inherent
            Vice</i>, released in October 2014; it features a new version of an unreleased Radiohead song, "Spooks",
        performed by Greenwood and two members of Supergrass. In May 2015, Yorke contributed a soundtrack, <i>Subterranea</i>,
        to <i>The</i> <i>Panic Office</i>, an installation of Radiohead artwork in Sydney, Australia. In November
        2015, <i>Junun</i>, a collaboration between Greenwood, Israeli composer <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Shye_Ben_Tzur'>Shye Ben Tzur</a> and Indian musicians,
        engineered and mixed Godrich, was released. It was accompanied by a documentary of the same name directed by
        Anderson.</p>
    <p>Radiohead began work on their ninth studio album in September 2014 in the La Fabrique studio near Saint-R&#233;my-de-Provence,
        France, joined again by Godrich. On Christmas Day 2015, they released a new song, "Spectre", on the audio
        streaming site SoundCloud. A "brooding" orchestral song, it was written for the James Bond film of the same
        name, but was rejected, in Greenwood's words, for being "too dark". On 30 April 2016, fans who had
        previously made orders from Radiohead received embossed cards with lyrics from a new song, "Burn the Witch".
        On 1 May, Radiohead deleted all content from their website and social media profiles and replaced them with
        blank images, a move Pitchfork interpreted as symbolic of the band's re-emergence. They released "Burn the
        Witch", the lead single from their forthcoming album, as a download on 3 May, accompanied by a stop-motion
        animated music video. On 6 May, Radiohead released another new download single, "Daydreaming", accompanied
        by a music video directed by Paul Thomas Anderson; the video was screened in <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_film'>35 mm film</a> in select cinemas.</p>
    <p>Radiohead's ninth studio album, <i>A Moon Shaped Pool</i>, was released digitally on 8 May 2016 on
        Radiohead's website and online music stores. It was followed by physical versions on 17 June via XL
        Recordings. It includes several songs written some years earlier, including "True Love Waits" (which dates
        to at least 1995), along with strings and choral vocals performed by the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Contemporary_Orchestra'>London Contemporary
            Orchestra</a> and additional percussion from Deamer. The album was simultaneously released on paid
        streaming
        services including Tidal and Apple Music, but was not released on Spotify, a free service, until 17 June,
        six weeks later. Spotify had been in "advanced discussions" with Radiohead&#8217;s management and label to
        make <i>A Moon Shaped Pool</i> the first album available exclusively to Spotify's paid subscribers, but the
        deal fell through, according to Spotify, due to technical hurdles. <i>In Rainbows,</i> the only other
        Radiohead album not previously available on Spotify, was added on 10 June. <i>A Moon Shaped Pool</i> debuted
        at number one in the UK album chart, becoming Radiohead's sixth UK number-one album. It was the fifth
        Radiohead album to be nominated for the Mercury Prize, making Radiohead the most shortlisted act in the
        award's history.</p>
    <p>Radiohead began a tour in support of <i>A Moon Shaped Pool</i> in May 2016, joined again by Deamer, with
        performances in Europe, North America, and Japan. The album's physical release was promoted with "Live From
        a Moon Shaped Pool", which took place in participating record shops around the world. The event featured a
        "day-long" audio stream, including playlists curated by Radiohead and a recording of their recent
        performance at the London Roundhouse, along with competitions, artwork, and other activities. Attendees in a
        record shop in Istanbul, Turkey, were attacked by a group of men who were angry that customers were drinking
        beer and playing music during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fast. Radiohead released a statement
        condemning the attacks and offering "love and support" to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul'
        >Istanbul</a> fans.</p>
    <h2>Style and songwriting</h2>
    <p>Among Radiohead members' earliest influences were Queen, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd'
    >Pink Floyd</a> and Elvis Costello,
        post-punk acts such as Joy Division, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Siouxsie_and_the_Banshees'
        >Siouxsie and the Banshees</a> and Magazine, and
        significantly 1980s alternative rock bands such as U2, R.E.M., Pixies, the Smiths and Sonic Youth. By the
        mid-1990s, Radiohead began to adopt some recording methods from hip hop, inspired by the sampling work of DJ
        Shadow, and became interested in using computers to generate sounds. Other influences on the group include
        the jazz music of Miles Davis, Charlie Mingus and Alice Coltrane, the soundtracks of Ennio Morricone, 1960s
        rock groups such as the Beatles and the Beach Boys, and Phil Spector's "wall of sound" production technique.

    <p>The electronic music of <i>Kid A</i> and <i>Amnesiac</i> was inspired by Yorke's admiration for glitch,
        ambient techno and IDM as exemplified by <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_Records'>Warp
            Records</a> artists such as <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Autechre'>Autechre</a> and Aphex
        Twin; in 2013, Yorke named <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex_Twin'>Aphex Twin</a> as
        biggest influence. The album also samples early computer music. The jazz of Charles Mingus, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Coltrane'>Alice Coltrane</a> and Miles Davis, and
        1970s krautrock bands such as Can and Neu!, were other major influences during this period. Jonny
        Greenwood's interest in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century_classical_music'>20th
            century classical music</a> also had a role, as the influence of composers <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Krzysztof_Penderecki'>Krzysztof Penderecki</a> and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Messiaen'>Olivier Messiaen</a> was apparent; for
        several songs on <i>Kid A</i> and later albums, Greenwood has played the ondes Martenot, an early electronic
        instrument popularised by Messiaen.</p>
    <p>Recording <i>In Rainbows</i>, Radiohead members mentioned a variety of rock, electronic, hip hop and
        experimental musicians as influences, including Bj&#246;rk, M.I.A, Liars, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Modeselektor'>Modeselektor</a> and Spank Rock. In 2011,
        Yorke denied that Radiohead had ever set out deliberately to change musical styles or to make "experimental
        music", saying the band was "constantly absorbing music" and that a variety of musicians are always
        influencing their work. Drummer Clive Deamer, who has recorded and performed with Radiohead since 2011, said
        that Radiohead did not see themselves as a rock band and felt their methodology had closer parallels with
        jazz: &#8220;they deliberately try to avoid clich&#233; and standard forms for the sake of the song ... Rock
        bands don&#8217;t do that. It&#8217;s far more like a jazz mentality."</p>
    <p>Since their formation, Radiohead have been lyrically and musically spearheaded by Yorke. Although Yorke is
        responsible for writing nearly all the lyrics, songwriting is a collaborative effort, with all the band
        members having roles in the process; all the band's songs are officially credited to "Radiohead". Radiohead
        songs usually begin with a sketch by Yorke, which is harmonically developed by Jonny Greenwood before the
        other members develop their own parts. The <i>Kid A</i> and <i>Amnesiac</i> sessions brought about a change
        in Radiohead's musical style and working method. Since their shift from conventional rock music
        instrumentation toward an emphasis on electronic sound, the members have gained flexibility and now
        regularly switch instruments depending on the particular song requirements. On <i>Kid A</i> and
        <i>Amnesiac</i>, Yorke played keyboard and bass, while Jonny Greenwood often played ondes Martenot rather
        than guitar, bassist Colin Greenwood worked on sampling, and O'Brien and Selway branched out to drum
        machines and digital manipulations, also finding ways to incorporate their primary instruments, guitar and
        percussion, respectively, into the new sound. The relaxed 2003 recording sessions for <i>Hail to the
            Thief</i> led to a different dynamic in Radiohead, with Yorke admitting in interviews that his power in
        the band had been "absolutely unbalanced" and that he would "subvert everybody else's power at all costs.
        But&#160;... it's actually a lot more healthy now, democracy-wise, than it used to be."</p>
    <h2>Collaborators</h2>

    <p>Radiohead have maintained a close relationship with a number of frequent collaborators. Producer Nigel
        Godrich made his name with Radiohead, working with the band as an audio engineer on <i>The Bends</i> and as
        their producer on every studio album afterwards. He has been dubbed the "sixth member" of the band, in an
        allusion to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin'>George Martin</a> being called the
        "Fifth Beatle". In 2016, Godrich said of the collaboration: "I can only ever have one band like Radiohead
        who I've worked with for this many years. That's a very deep and profound relationship. <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles'>The Beatles</a> could only have ever had one
        George Martin; they couldn't have switched producers halfway through their career. All that work, trust, and
        knowledge of each other would have been thrown out of the window and they'd have to start again."</p>
    <p>Graphic artist Stanley Donwood met Yorke when both were art students, and with Yorke has produced all of
        Radiohead's album covers and visual artwork since 1994. Donwood works in the studio with the band as they
        record, allowing the music to influence the artwork. He and Yorke won a Grammy in 2002 for the special
        edition of <i>Amnesiac</i> packaged as a library book.</p>
    <p>Dilly Gent has been responsible for commissioning all Radiohead music videos since <i>OK Computer</i>,
        working with the band to find a director suitable for each project. Since Radiohead's inception, Andi Watson
        has been their lighting and stage director, designing the visuals of live concerts, such as the
        carbon-neutral "LED forest" of the <i>In Rainbows</i> tour. Radiohead's chief live technician, Peter "Plank"
        Clements, has worked with the band since before <i>The Bends</i>, overseeing the setup of their instruments
        for studio recordings and live performances. Drummer <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Deamer'
        >Clive Deamer</a> has performed and
        recorded with Radiohead since 2011.</p>
