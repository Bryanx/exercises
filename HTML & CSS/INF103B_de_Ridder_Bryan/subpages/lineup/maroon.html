    <p><b>Maroon 5</b> is an American pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles, California. It currently consists of
        lead vocalist Adam Levine, lead guitarist James Valentine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael,
        bassist Mickey Madden, drummer Matt Flynn, and keyboardist PJ Morton. Before the current group was established,
        the original four members, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Levine'>Adam Levine</a> (lead
        vocals, lead guitar), <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Carmichael'>Jesse Carmichael</a>
        (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Madden'>Mickey Madden</a>
        (bass guitar) and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dusick'>Ryan Dusick</a> (drums), formed a
        band known as <b>Kara's Flowers</b> in 1994, while they were still in high school. The band, which self-released
        an album called <i>We Like Digging?</i>, then signed to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprise_Records'
        >Reprise Records</a> and released the album
        <i>The Fourth World</i> in 1997. After the album garnered a tepid response, the band parted ways with the record
        label and the members attended college.</p>
    <p>In 2001, the band changed its image by adding guitarist James Valentine and pursuing a new direction under the
        name Maroon 5. At this point, Carmichael switched to playing keyboards, which has since become his main
        instrument in the band. After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with a subsidiary of J Records, Octone Records, and
        released their debut album, <i>Songs About Jane</i>, in June 2002. The album's lead single, "Harder to Breathe",
        received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. In
        2004, the album went platinum and has been dubbed "the sleeper hit of the millennium". The band won the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award'>Grammy Award</a> for Best New Artist in 2005.
        For the next few years, Maroon 5 toured extensively worldwide in support of <i>Songs About Jane</i> and produced
        two live recordings: 2004's <i>1.22.03.Acoustic</i> and 2005's <i>Live&#160;&#8211; Friday the 13th</i>. In
        2006, Dusick officially left Maroon 5 after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced
        by Matt Flynn. The band then recorded their second album, <i>It Won't Be Soon Before Long</i> and released it in
        May 2007. The album reached number one on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart and the lead single, "Makes Me
        Wonder", became the band's first number-one single on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100.</p>
    <p>In September 2010, Maroon 5 released their third studio album <i>Hands All Over</i>, which was re-released in
        2011 to include the single "Moves like Jagger" featuring Christina Aguilera. While the original version of the
        album received mixed reviews, "Moves like Jagger" reached the number one position on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot
        100. The band released their fourth album, <i>Overexposed</i>, on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the album
        were highly successful on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, including second single "One More Night", which reached
        number one for 9 weeks straight. Keyboardist <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Morton'>PJ
            Morton</a> became an official member of the band in 2012, after gaining little success with his previous
        albums
        as an R&amp;B vocalist. The addition of PJ Morton meant that for the first time, Maroon 5 had six official
        members. The same year, the bass player of Phantom Planet, Sam Farrar, became an official touring member,
        playing many different instruments (including guitars, percussion and additional keyboards), singing backing
        vocals and also providing samples and other special effects. In 2014, the band signed with <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Interscope_Records'>Interscope Records</a> and released their
        fifth studio album, <i>V</i>. Maroon 5 has sold more than 20 million albums and 70 million singles worldwide.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>1994&#8211;2002: Kara's Flowers and the formation of Maroon 5
    </h3>
    <p>Adam Levine was introduced to Ryan Dusick by a mutual friend and guitarist, Adam Salzman. Levine was 15 years old
        and Dusick was 16. Three of the five members of the band started playing together at age 12. The four original
        members of the band met while attending Brentwood EMH School in Los Angeles. While attending Brentwood EMH
        School, Adam Levine and Jesse Carmichael joined up with Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick to form Kara's Flowers, a
        rock band. The name was taken from a girl that went to their high school that the band had a "collective crush"
        on. In 1997, when the band was playing at a beach party in Malibu, independent producer Tommy Allen heard them
        play and offered to manage them and record a complete record with his partner, songwriter John DeNicola, who is
        known for his work on <i>Dirty Dancing</i>&#160;&#8211; including "(I've Had) The Time of My Life". Producer Rob
        Cavallo's management team heard the record Allen and DeNicola produced, which eventually led Cavallo to offer
        them a deal with Reprise Records. However, after the release of <i>The Fourth World</i>, during Levine and
        Madden's senior year of high school in 1997, it had morphed into a band with a style reminiscent of 1960s
        Britpop. Despite high expectations from the band and record company, the album failed to catch on and their lead
        single, "Soap Disco", was a failure. According to Levine, the failure of the album was "a huge disappointment"
        that nearly led them to break up in 1998. The album sold around 5,000 copies and the band was dropped after one
        month.</p>
    <p>Dusick and Madden attended college locally at UCLA, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the East coast to
        attend Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York. While Levine and Carmichael were in New York,
        they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they
        wrote.</p>
    <p>The band returned to the music industry again in 2000. Producer <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Sommer'
    >Tim Sommer</a> signed them to a
        demo deal with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/MCA_Records'>MCA Records</a> and produced three
        tracks with them in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles'>Los Angeles</a> in the middle of
        2000 with Mark Dearnley engineering. Against Sommer's advice, MCA declined to pick up the band, and these tracks
        were never released. The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before falling into the
        hands of <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Octone_Records'>Octone Records</a> executives James
        Diener, Ben Berkman and David Boxenbaum. While looking for talent for the new Octone label, Berkman was given a
        bunch of demos by the brother of a former colleague at <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Records'
        >Columbia Records</a> and the song that
        caught his attention was "'Sunday Morning'" which he referred it as a "genius song". Berkman was surprised the
        song was credited to Kara's Flowers because the band sounded completely different from the one he had heard
        while at Warner Brothers.</p>
    <p>Berkman encouraged Diener and Boxenbaum to fly out to Los Angeles to watch a showcase gig at <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Viper_Room'>The Viper Room</a> for the four-piece Kara's
        Flowers. After watching Levine onstage, they were convinced. Berkman told <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/HitQuarters'>HitQuarters</a> he believed what the band needed
        was a "fifth member to play the guitar and free up the singer, so he could be the star I perceived him to be."
        Octone immediately insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past. Also, the label began
        looking for a full-time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman. James Valentine (from
        the L.A. band Square) was recruited for the job. On his joining the band, Valentine commented: "I became friends
        with them and we sort of started jamming together, it was very much like I was cheating on my band, we were
        having sort of an affair and I eventually quit my other band to join up with them."</p>
    <h3>2002&#8211;06: <i>Songs About Jane</i> and Dusick's departure
    </h3>


    <p>James Valentine attended <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Berklee_College_of_Music'>Berklee College
        of Music</a> with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayer'>John Mayer</a> in 1996, where they
        developed a rapport. In 2002, the two reconnected at a Mayer radio appearance. After Mayer heard their album, he
        was so impressed (particularly by "This Love", which became the most successful release off the album and
        propelled the band to superstardom) that he invited them to open for him during his early 2003 tour. The first
        single, "Harder to Breathe", slowly started to pick up airplay which helped spur sales of the album. By March
        2004, <i>Songs About Jane</i> had reached the Top 20 of the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and "Harder to Breathe" had
        made the Top 20 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 singles charts. The album peaked at No.&#160;6 on the <i>Billboard</i>
        200 in September 2004, 26 months after its release; this was the longest period between an album's release and
        its initial Top 10 appearance since SoundScan results were included in the <i>Billboard</i> 200 in 1991. The
        album went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide. This had all happened after the band "abandoned its
        post-grunge roots for a radio-friendly pop-soul sound, even while dabbling in hard rock." Mayer invited the band
        to open for him again in 2004. Over the next three years, the band toured virtually non-stop, including visits
        to seventeen countries. During this time, the band toured with Michelle Branch, Graham Colton, and the Rolling
        Stones. Other acts the band toured alongside with included Gavin DeGraw, Matchbox Twenty, Sugar Ray, Counting
        Crows, Phantom Planet, the Hives, Dashboard Confessional, Simon Dawes, the Thrills, Thirsty Merc, Marc
        Broussard, the Donnas, the RedWest, Michael Tolcher, and Guster.</p>
    <p>Sam Farrar says the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaliyah'>Aaliyah</a> song "Are You That
        Somebody?" affected the band and influenced the song "Not Coming Home."</p>
    <p><i>Songs About Jane</i> eventually reached No.&#160;1 on the Australian albums (ARIA), while "Harder to Breathe"
        made the Top 20 singles charts in the US and UK, and Top 40 in Australia and New Zealand. The album also
        eventually climbed to No.&#160;1 in the UK. The second single, "This Love", reached No.&#160;5 in the US, No.&#160;3
        in the UK, and No.&#160;8 in Australia. The third single, "She Will Be Loved," reached the Top 5 in both the US
        and the UK, and went to No.&#160;1 in Australia. The fourth single, "Sunday Morning," reached the Top 40 in the
        US, UK, and Australia. Maroon 5 also played Live 8, in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia'
        >Philadelphia</a> in 2005. Their set
        included a cover of Neil Young's "Rockin' In The Free World" and frontman Levine performed with one of his
        heroes, and the closing act, Stevie Wonder. On May 13, 2005, in Santa Barbara, California, the band wrapped up
        the Honda Civic Tour, which it headlined. On June 9, 2005, the band performed at the American Film Institute's
        tribute to filmmaker George Lucas. Lucas himself had selected Maroon 5 for the event, as it was his children's
        favorite band at the time. Over the years of touring with the band their drummer, percussionist and backing
        vocalist Ryan Dusick had been suffering from the touring life. The strains of non-stop touring aggravated an old
        sports injury. After several absences from the tour with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryland_Steen'
        >Ryland Steen</a> and Josh Day taking his
        place, Dusick officially left Maroon 5 in September 2006. Matt Flynn, the former drummer of <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_DeGraw'>Gavin DeGraw</a> and the B-52's, joined the band
        as Dusick's replacement.</p>
    <h3>2006&#8211;08: <i>It Won't Be Soon Before Long</i>
    </h3>


    <p>After recording for 8 months in 2006, Maroon 5's second album, <i>It Won't Be Soon Before Long</i>, was released
        worldwide in May 2007 by A&amp;M Octone Records. According to Levine, the follow-up to <i>Songs About Jane</i>
        is "sexier and stronger", gaining inspiration from iconic 80s artists such as Prince, Shabba Ranks, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson'>Michael Jackson</a> and Talking Heads. Ann
        Powers writing for <i>Los Angeles Times</i> said <i>It Won't Be Soon Long</i> is "An icy-hot blend of
        electro-funk and blue-eyed soul that works its cruel streak with the confidence of Daniel Craig's James Bond".
        Before its release, "Makes Me Wonder" was the No.&#160;1 selling single and video on iTunes. It was also the No.&#160;1
        selling album, with more than 50,000 digital pre-sales. After its release, the album broke iTunes sales records
        its week of release, selling over 101,000 albums. The first single, "Makes Me Wonder," was released to radio
        March 27, 2007. The song debuted at number 84 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, the lowest debuting single of the
        group's five chart entries. In the first week of May, the single skyrocketed from a lowly position of No.&#160;64
        to No.&#160;1, the biggest jump in <i>Billboard</i> history at the time. "Makes Me Wonder" has also achieved No.&#160;1
        on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs, Pop 100, and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Dance_Club_Play'
        >Hot Dance Club Play</a> charts.</p>
    <p>To support the album, the band performed on a "six-date club tour" in which it visited small venues in Boston,
        San Francisco, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Miami, and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City'>New
            York City</a> in early June 2007. The band followed with a concert that streamed live via <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Music'>MSN Music</a> in mid-June. On July 10, it opened
        for The Police, in Miami, and followed with an acoustic performance at the Miami club, Studio A, the next day.
        Their <i>It Won't Be Soon Before Long</i> world tour took place in 2007, where the band toured 28 cities in
        North America. The tour began September 29 in Detroit touring in 28 cities in <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America'>North America</a> and concluded November 10 in
        Las Vegas. the Hives, as the tour's special guest, performed on all of the dates while Sara Bareilles, Kevin
        Michael, and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_Planet'>Phantom Planet</a> each performed in a
        portion of the tour. It toured with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_Confessional'>Dashboard
            Confessional</a> in their world tour and on March 28, 2008, it began touring with OneRepublic, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandi_Carlile'>Brandi Carlile</a> and Ry Cuming. The band has
        also performed "Makes Me Wonder" on season 6 and "If I Never See Your Face Again" on season 7 of <i>American
            Idol</i>. The re-release of the album featured a new duet version of "If I Never See Your Face Again" with
        Rihanna; the new version of the song also appeared on the re-release of Rihanna's album <i>Good Girl Gone
            Bad</i>. The band also released as the fifth single "Goodnight Goodnight", which appeared in the opening of
        the <i>CSI: NY</i> episode "Page Turner" in 2008.</p>
    <h3>2008&#8211;11: <i>Hands All Over</i></h3>

    <p>Levine stated that he believed the band was reaching its peak and may make one more album before disbanding. He
        explained, "Eventually I want to focus on being a completely different person because I don&#8217;t know if I
        want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond, like the Rolling Stones".</p>
    <p>The band's third studio album was recorded in 2009 in Switzerland, where the band was joined by record producer
        Robert John "Mutt" Lange. The album, titled <i>Hands All Over</i>, was released on September 21, 2010. On the
        <i>Billboard</i> 200, the album debuted at number two behind Zac Brown Band's album <i>You Get What You Give</i>.
        Despite the high placement on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 only 142,000 copies were sold, which was relatively weak
        compared to their previous album <i>It Won't Be Soon Before Long</i>, which debuted at number one with 429,000
        copies. The album received mixed reviews from music critics, though many of them praised it for its production.
        Many critics assumed that the low numbers were caused by illegal internet downloading, also known as piracy, and
        ignored it. The first single from the album, "Misery", was released on June 22, 2010. The band toured with Train
        for the summer of 2011, from July 22 to September 24.</p>
    <p>On June 12, 2011, the band re-released the album <i>Hands All Over</i> just to include their summer hit "Moves
        like Jagger", featuring Christina Aguilera. The song premiered live on <i>The Voice</i> on June 21, 2011 and
        reached the number one position on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart in September 2011. Frontman Levine was
        also featured in the Gym Class Heroes' song "Stereo Hearts", which peaked at number four on the <i>Billboard</i>
        Hot 100. On September 8, 2011, Jesse Carmichael stated the band was likely to begin recording its next album
        within the year. On October 1, 2011, the band performed live at the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_in_Rio'>Rock in Rio</a> concert in Rio de Janeiro,
        Brazil. Maroon 5 was a last hour addition, chosen to fill the vacant spot left by <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z'>Jay-Z</a> after he cancelled his appearance for
        personal reasons. The band launched a <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapple'>Snapple</a> flavor
        named "Tea Will Be Loved" in support of <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_America'>Feeding
            America</a> in September 2011.</p>
    <p>Maroon 5 performed "Moves Like Jagger" and "Stereo Hearts" with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Travie_McCoy'
    >Travie McCoy</a> on November 5,
        2011 on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. The band also performed "Moves Like Jagger" and "Stereo Hearts" with <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Aguilera'>Christina Aguilera</a> and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym_Class_Heroes'>Gym Class Heroes</a> on November 20, 2011 on
        the American Music Awards, where it won its first AMA for Favorite Pop Band/Duo/Group. The band also performed
        "Moves Like Jagger" at the 2011 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. During a promotion by <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola'>Coca-Cola</a> in the March 2011, the band
        participated in a special studio session during which, with the help of musician PJ Morton, they only had 24
        hours to write a completely original song. After their time was up, the song "Is Anybody Out There" was released
        on the Coca-Cola website for free download. In 2012, the band recorded a song for <i>The Hunger Games</i>
        soundtrack, called "Come Away to the Water" featuring Rozzi Crane. At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards, on February
        12, 2012, the group performed alongside <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_the_People'>Foster
            the People</a> and the Beach Boys in a medley of the Beach Boys songs to celebrate their fiftieth
        anniversary.

    <h3>2012&#8211;14: Carmichael's hiatus and <i>Overexposed</i>
    </h3>

    <p>On March 9, 2012, Maroon 5 announced that Jesse Carmichael would take a break from performing with the group for
        an undetermined amount of time to focus more on his studies of "music and the healing arts". The band continued
        to work on their fourth studio album <i>Overexposed</i>, which was eventually released on June 26, 2012, with
        the help of keyboardist and background vocalist PJ Morton, who had been touring with them since 2010 and became
        a full-time band member as a Keyboardist and backup vocalist after the announcement, as Morton gained little
        success as an R&amp;B vocalist. Levine stated that <i>Overexposed</i> is their "most diverse and poppiest album
        yet". On April 16, 2012, the band premiered the first single from the album "Payphone", featuring Wiz Khalifa,
        on the reality competition television show <i>The Voice</i>, in which Levine is one of the coaches. The song
        debuted at number three on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart, eventually peaking at number two. The second
        single, "One More Night", was released on June 19, 2012. The song reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot
        100, blocking Psy's monster hit "Gangnam Style" from the top spot on the chart for nine consecutive weeks and
        tied with Carly Rae Jepsen's hit single "Call Me Maybe" for most number of weeks in the number one spot on the
        <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart in 2012.</p>
    <p>At the start of their Overexposed World Tour in South America, Maroon 5 introduced the newest addition in the
        band to the audience: their old and close friend <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Farrar'>Sam
            Farrar</a> on guitars, occasionally on the bass guitar, percussion, additional keyboards, backing vocals,
        turntables and providing samples and other special effects (using the MPC). Farrar co-wrote and co-produced a
        few of the band's songs on almost all of their studio albums and also remixed their song "Woman" (from the <i>Spider-Man
            2</i>) on <i>Call and Response: The Remix Album</i>, released in 2008.</p>
    <p>On November 27, 2012, the band released "Daylight", the third single from the album. To promote the song, the
        band launched a video project called "The Daylight Project". The project encouraged fans to film their own
        segments for inclusion in the official music video for "Daylight", that would be directed by Jonas &#197;kerlund.
        "Daylight" was performed for the first time as a single on November 8, 2012, during an episode of the American
        version of <i>The Voice</i> and the official video was released on December 10, 2012. A little over 4 months
        later in the first week of April 2013, "Daylight" reached No. 1 on the Mainstream top 40, setting a record for
        the most No. 1's held by a group in over 20 years. </p>
    <p>On April 1, 2013, the band announced it would headline the 12th Annual <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Civic_Tour'>Honda Civic Tour</a> with special guest, Kelly
        Clarkson. The tour began on August 1, 2013, at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in St. Louis, Missouri and
        ended on October 6, 2013, with a concert at the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Bowl'>Hollywood
            Bowl</a> in Los Angeles. On May 14, 2013, Maroon 5 released the fourth and final single from the album,
        "Love
        Somebody". The band first performed the song on <i>The Voice</i> on May 20, 2013, while the official music
        video, directed by Rich Lee, was released the day after.</p>
    <p>In February 2014, the band performed "All My Loving" and "Ticket to Ride" at a tribute concert titled <i>The
        Night That Changed America</i>, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of The Beatles' arrival in the United
        States.</p>
    <h3>2014&#8211;present: Return of Carmichael, <i>V</i> and upcoming sixth studio album
    </h3>
    <p>In April 2013, James Valentine said the band was in the studio recording songs for the upcoming fifth studio
        album: "The stuff we're working on now, it definitely has gone maybe a little darker in its sound, maybe back a
        little bit more to what we kind of did on <i>Songs About Jane</i>, but at this point we do have all kinds of
        different songs and it is early".</p>
    <p>On April 15, 2014, Jesse Carmichael confirmed that his hiatus from the band was complete and he reunited with the
        band in time to record for <i>V</i>. On April 29, 2014, the band performed on the <i>Today Show</i> at the
        Rockefeller Plaza in New York City on September 1, 2014, as part of the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota'>Toyota</a> concert series.</p>
    <p>On May 18, 2014, it was announced that the band would release their fifth album, <i>V</i>, on September 2, 2014,
        through Interscope Records. The first single, "Maps", was released on June 16, 2014. The single peaked number 6
        on the Hot 100 chart. After releasing the album <i>V</i> on September 2, 2014 it reached number one on the US
        <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart on September 20, 2014. The album was also released on a limited-edition ZinePak.
        <i>V</i> received mixed reviews from critics. Brad Wete, writing for <i>Billboard</i>, said: "Levine's
        hummingbird vocals and passionate delivery are as earnest as they were on their 2002 debut <i>Songs About
            Jane</i>."</p>
    <p>On August 10, 2014, the band headlined the Hyundai Card City Break, a rock festival in South Korea. Maroon 5 also
        performed during the 2014 iTunes Festival at the Roundhouse in London, England, on September 11, 2014 (all of
        the concerts played as part of the festival were filmed and webcast live, around the world). The second single
        from <i>V</i>, "Animals", was first featured in a <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Soul'>Kia
            Soul</a> commercial and made available for free download on the official Kia website for a limited time
        after
        the advert premiered on August 21, 2014. The song has so far peaked on number 3 on the Hot 100 chart.</p>
    <p>Maroon 5 performed at the Grammy Awards' Christmas special, entitled "A Very Grammy Christmas," on November 18,
        2014 and at Z100's <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingle_Ball'>Jingle Ball</a> on December 12,
        2014.</p>
    <p>"Sugar" was released as the third single from the album on January 14 2015. This reached number 9 in the Vodafone
        BigTop40 Charts and peaked at Number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. A video of the group was released of them
        traveling around L.A. and performing at random weddings. The song is also featured in a <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan'>Nissan</a> commercial.</p>
    <p>Maroon 5 started their new worldwide tour in February 2015. It is scheduled to take place in North America,
        Europe, Africa, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia'>Asia</a> and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania'>Oceania</a> and last until September 2015. MAGIC!,
        Rozzi Crane, Nick Gardner and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Loops'>Dirty Loops</a> will
        serve as opening acts.</p>
    <p>The band released their first greatest hits album, <i>Singles</i>, on September 25, 2015, through Interscope and
        222 Records. It contains 12 singles taken from their previous studio albums.</p>
    <p>On November 6, 2015, the band announced that they would embark on their 2016 North American tour in September and
        October with supporting acts Tove Lo, R. City, and PHASES. Guitarist James Valentine spoke about the band's
        strategy moving onto their sixth studio album, saying the group wanted "to make a more traditional record next
        ... like the way we made <i>Songs About Jane</i>, just sitting in a room with our instruments and slugging it
        out. It&#8217;s been fun to experiment on the last couple of records with the more electronic sounds, but maybe
        we&#8217;ve gone as far as we can with that for now."</p>
    <p>June 25, 2016, the 15th anniversary of <i>Songs About Jane</i>'s release, had the celebration of
        <b>#Maroon5Day</b>,
        in a partnership with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF'>UNICEF</a> to support children in
        need of health care.</p>
    <p>A new song featuring Kendrick Lamar, titled "Don't Wanna Know", will be released to Top 40 radio on October 18,
        2016.</p>
    <h2>Musical style and influences</h2>

    <p>Adam Levine has stated: "[E]verything that's written and performed and put together pretty much comes from us. I
        just think people would be surprised to know that we&#8217;re a self-contained unit. We&#8217;re a band that
        does their own thing. There&#8217;s no puppet master." However, in an article about the songwriter and producer
        Benny Blanco, it is revealed that at least some of the band's songs, such as "Moves like Jagger," are the
        product of efforts by, or collaborations with, professional songwriters and producers. In the same article,
        Levine says, "It's almost as if [Benny Blanco] has the Midas touch in putting the right people together at the
        right time to create a musical moment. He's about the collaboration. And he's so good at nailing down who does
        everything best."</p>
    <p>The band has cited Elita 5, Michael Jackson, The Police, the Bee Gees, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, Tonic,
        Prince, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur'>Tupac Shakur</a> and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Gaye'>Marvin Gaye</a> as influences. Adam Levine has
        also cited <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Joel'>Billy Joel</a> as an influence. Furthermore,
        guitarist James Valentine said he was influenced by guitarists like Pat Metheny, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Frisell'>Bill Frisell</a> and John Scofield, as well as
        the rock band Queens of the Stone Age. The band's songs tend to be very guitar-heavy, often accompanied by piano
        or synthesizer. The theme in most of their songs is love, frequently lost love; songs like "This Love", "Makes
        Me Wonder" and "Misery" have a very cynical tone, often expressing dissatisfaction with a relationship, while
        their more heartfelt and emotional songs such as "She Will Be Loved" and "Never Gonna Leave This Bed" express a
        longing for a romantic relationship. "Makes Me Wonder" has a secondary theme, in which Levine expresses his
        disillusionment and frustration with the state of American politics and the Iraq War.</p>
    <p>The band's style changes from album to album. <i>Songs About Jane</i> consists of songs about Levine's
        ex-girlfriend Jane. On <i>It Won't Be Soon Before Long</i>, however, the songs are less personal and are more
        electric with more use of synthesizers, creating a retro feel. <i>Hands All Over</i> continues the band's lost
        love theme, along with songs about infatuation and was re-released in 2011, with the hit single "Moves like
        Jagger", an electropop song which represents a drastic change in the band's sound, with more of a dance feel to
        it. "It was one of those songs that was definitely a risk," Levine said. "It's a bold statement. We've never
        really released a song like that. But it's exciting to do something different, do something new. I'm just glad
        that everyone likes it." James Valentine called <i>Overexposed</i> "our most 'pop' record ever and we weren&#8217;t
        shy about really going for it." They also have experimented with new wave and disco sounds on several albums.
