    <p><b>Guns N' Roses</b> is an American hard rock band from <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles'>Los
        Angeles</a> formed in 1985. The classic lineup, as signed to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Geffen_Records'>Geffen
        Records</a> in 1986, consisted of vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin,
        bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan,
        keyboardists <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizzy_Reed'>Dizzy Reed</a> and Melissa Reese, guitarist <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Fortus'>Richard Fortus</a> and drummer Frank Ferrer. The band
        has released six studio albums, accumulating sales of more than 100 million records worldwide, including
        shipments of 45 million in the United States, making Guns N' Roses one of the world's best-selling bands of all
        time.</p>
    <p>Guns N' Roses' debut album, <i>Appetite for Destruction</i> (1987), reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i>
        200 a year after its release, on the strength of "Sweet Child o' Mine", the group's only single to reach number
        one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. The album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide, including 18
        million units in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the US, as well as the
        eleventh best-selling album in the United States. The success of the debut was followed by the eight-song album
        <i>G N' R Lies</i> (1988) which reached number two on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. The twin albums <i>Use Your
            Illusion I</i> and <i>Use Your Illusion II</i> (1991) debuted at number two and number one on the <i>Billboard</i>
        200 respectively and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide, including 14 million units in the United
        States. The cover album <i>"The Spaghetti Incident?"</i> (1993) was the band's last studio album to feature
        Slash and McKagan.</p>
    <p>After more than a decade of work and several lineup changes, Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited album <i>Chinese
        Democracy</i> (2008) which, at an estimated $14 million in production costs, is the most expensive rock album to
        ever be produced in music history. It debuted at number three on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 but undersold industry
        expectations, despite mostly positive critical reception. Classic era members Slash and McKagan both rejoined
        the band in 2016.</p>
    <p>Guns N' Roses has been credited with reviving the mainstream popularity of rock music, at a time when popular
        music was dominated by dance music and glam metal. Its late 1980s and early 1990s years have been described as
        the period in which the group brought forth a "hedonistic rebelliousness" reminiscent of the early Rolling
        Stones, a reputation that had earned the group the nickname "the most dangerous band in the world". The band's
        classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer Matt Sorum, was inducted into the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame'>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 2012, in
        its first year of eligibility.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>Formation (1985&#8211;1986)</h3>


    <p>In 1984, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Rose'>Hollywood Rose</a> member <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Izzy_Stradlin'>Izzy Stradlin</a> was living with <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Guns'>L.A. Guns</a> member Tracii Guns. When L.A. Guns needed a new
        vocalist, Stradlin suggested Hollywood Rose singer Axl Rose. Guns N' Roses was formed in March 1985 by Rose and
        rhythm guitarist Stradlin, along with lead guitarist Tracii Guns, bassist Ole Beich, and drummer Rob Gardner of
        L.A. Guns. The band coined its name by combining the names of both previous groups. Rejected names for the band
        included "Heads of Amazon" and "AIDS". After a short time, during which the band reportedly played two or three
        shows, Beich was fired and replaced by Duff McKagan. <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracii_Guns'>Tracii
            Guns</a> left the band after an argument with Rose, leading to his replacement by Rose and Stradlin's
        one-time Hollywood Rose bandmate, Slash. Gardner quit soon after and was replaced by another former Hollywood
        Rose member, Steven Adler. Slash had also previously played with McKagan and Adler in Road Crew.</p>

    <p>In June 1985, four days after the lineup was finalized, the band embarked on a short, disorganized tour of the
        West Coast, from Sacramento, California, to McKagan's hometown of Seattle, Washington. The so-called "Hell Tour"
        settled the band's first stable lineup, with McKagan later commenting, "This trip had set a new benchmark for
        what we were capable of, what we could and would put ourselves through to achieve our goals as a band."</p>
    <p>Through the band's increasing presence on the Hollywood club scene &#8211; playing famed bars such as The
        Troubadour and The Roxy &#8211; Guns N' Roses drew the attention of major record labels. The group was signed by
        Geffen Records in March 1986, receiving a $75,000 advance. In December of that year, the group released the
        four-song EP <i>Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide</i>, designed to keep interest in the band alive while the group
        withdrew from the club scene to work in the studio. The EP contained covers of Rose Tattoo's "Nice Boys" and
        Aerosmith's "Mama Kin", along with two original compositions: the punk-influenced "Reckless Life" and the
        classic rock-inspired "Move to the City." Although billed as a live recording, the four songs were taken from
        the band's demo tapes and overdubbed with crowd noise. <i>Live&#160;?!*@ Like a Suicide</i> was released on the
        Geffen subsidiary Uzi Suicide, with production limited to 10,000 vinyl copies.</p>

    <h3>Breakthrough and mass popularity (1987&#8211;1989)</h3>
    <h4><i>Appetite for Destruction</i></h4>
    <p>Guns N' Roses' debut album <i>Appetite for Destruction</i> was released July 21, 1987. The album underwent an
        artwork change after the original cover design by Robert Williams, which depicted a surrealist scene in which a
        dagger-toothed monster vengefully attacks a robot rapist, was deemed too controversial. The band stated the
        original artwork was "a symbolic social statement, with the robot representing the industrial system that's
        raping and polluting our environment." The revised cover was done by Andy Engell, based on a design by tattoo
        artist Bill White Jr., who had designed the artwork for a tattoo Rose had acquired the previous year. The
        artwork featured each of the five band members' skulls layered on a cross.</p>
    <p>In the U.S., "Welcome to the Jungle" was issued as the album's first single, with an accompanying music video.
        Initially, the album and single lingered for almost a year without performing well, but when Geffen founder <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Geffen'>David Geffen</a> was asked to lend support to the band, he
        obliged, personally convincing <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV'>MTV</a> executives to play "Welcome to
        the Jungle" during the network's after-hours rotation. Even though the video was initially only played once at 4
        a.m. on a Sunday, heavy metal and hard rock fans took notice and soon began requesting the video and song en
        masse. The song, written in Seattle, was about Los Angeles. The music video took place in New York. According to
        Rose, the inspiration for the lyrics came from an encounter he and a friend had with a homeless man while they
        were coming out of a bus into New York. Trying to put a scare into the young runaways, the man yelled at them,
        "You know where you are? You're in the jungle baby; you're gonna die!" The song was featured in the 1988 Dirty
        Harry film <i>The Dead Pool</i>, starring Clint Eastwood, and members of the band had a cameo appearance in the
        film.</p>

    <p>"Sweet Child o' Mine" was the album's second U.S. single, a love song co-written by Rose as a poem for his
        then-girlfriend Erin Everly, daughter of Don Everly of the Everly Brothers. Due to the growing grassroots
        success of the band and the cross-gender appeal of the song, "Sweet Child o' Mine" and its accompanying music
        video received heavy airplay on both radio and MTV, becoming a huge hit during the summer of 1988 and reaching
        the top of the charts in the U.S. Slash later commented, "I hated that song with a huge passion for the longest
        time, and it turned out to be our hugest hit, so it goes to show what I know." The song was released in Japan as
        part of the EP <i>Live from the Jungle</i>, which also featured a selection of live recordings from the band's
        June 1987 dates at London's The Marquee, the group's first shows outside the United States. The song is the
        highest charting Guns N' Roses song, and is the group's only to reach number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot
        100.</p>
    <p>After the success of "Sweet Child o' Mine", "Welcome to the Jungle" was re-issued as a single and reached No.&#160;7
        in the U.S. By the time "Paradise City" and its video reached the airwaves, peaking at No.&#160;5 in the U.S.,
        <i>Appetite for Destruction</i> had reached No.&#160;1 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. To date, the album has sold
        in excess of 30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units sold in the United States, making it the
        best-selling debut album of all time in the U.S, in addition to being the eleventh best-selling album in the
        United States.</p>
    <p>Guns N' Roses toured extensively in support of the group's debut album, embarking on the 16-month-long <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite_for_Destruction'>Appetite for Destruction</a> Tour. In addition to
        headlining dates in Europe and the U.S., the band opened North American shows for The Cult, M&#246;tley Cr&#252;e,
        and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Cooper'>Alice Cooper</a> throughout the second half of 1987. During
        the 1987 tour, drummer <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Adler'>Steven Adler</a> broke his hand in a
        fight, and was replaced for 8 shows by Cinderella drummer Fred Coury. Bassist <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff_McKagan'>Duff McKagan</a> missed several shows in May 1988 to
        attend his wedding; Kid "Haggis" Chaos from <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cult'>The Cult</a> filled in.
        <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Henley'>Don Henley</a> of <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eagles'>The
            Eagles</a> played drums for the band during the 1989 AMA show while Adler was in rehab.</p>
    <p>The band proceeded to tour the United States, Australia and Japan, while serving as opening acts on North America
        shows by <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden'>Iron Maiden</a> and Aerosmith. Tim Collins, Aerosmith's
        then-manager, remarked, "By the end of the tour, Guns N' Roses were huge. They basically just exploded. We were
        all pissed that <i>Rolling Stone</i> showed up to do a story on Aerosmith, but Guns N' Roses ended up on the
        cover of the magazine. Suddenly, the opening act was bigger than we were."</p>
    <h4><i>G N' R Lies</i></h4>

    <p>Guns N' Roses' next album, <i>G N' R Lies</i>, was released in November 1988. It included the four recordings
        from the band's 1986 EP <i>Live&#160;?!*@ Like a Suicide</i>, as well as four new acoustic tracks. "Patience",
        the only single released from <i>G N' R Lies</i>, peaked at No.&#160;4 in the U.S., while the album itself
        reached No.&#160;2 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. The album cover, a parody of tabloid newspapers, was modified
        after initial pressings to remove the headlines "Wife-beating has been around for 10,000 years" and "Ladies,
        welcome to the dark ages".</p>
    <p>The song "One in a Million" raised accusations of racism and homophobia. Rose denied that he was a racist and
        defended his use of a racial slur, claiming that "it's a word to describe somebody that is basically a pain in
        your life, a problem. The word nigger doesn't necessarily mean black," although he later conceded that he had
        used the word as an insult towards black people who had tried to rob him. In response to the allegations of
        homophobia, Rose stated that he considered himself "pro-heterosexual" and blamed this attitude on "bad
        experiences" with gay men.</p>
    <p>Guns N' Roses' late 1980s shows were often eventful for more than just the band's performance. During a November
        1987 show in Atlanta, Rose assaulted a security guard and was held backstage by police, while his band mates
        continued playing with a roadie singing. Riots nearly broke out during two August 1988 shows in New York State.
        At England's <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters_of_Rock'>Monsters of Rock</a> festival, held that same
        month, two fans were crushed to death during the group's set by the slam-dancing crowd. During the first of four
        October 1989 dates opening for the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stones'>Rolling Stones</a> at the
        L.A. Coliseum, Rose announced that the shows would be the group's last if certain members of the band did not
        stop "dancing with Mr. Brownstone," a reference to the band's song of the same name about heroin. Events such as
        these helped earn Guns N' Roses the moniker "The Most Dangerous Band in the World."</p>

    <h3>International success and band turmoil (1990&#8211;1993)</h3>
    <h4><i>Use Your Illusion I</i> and <i>II</i></h4>
    <p>In 1990, Guns N' Roses returned to the studio to begin recording the band's most ambitious undertaking yet.
        Drummer Steven Adler was briefly fired from the band over his drug use, but he was reinstated after signing a
        contract in which he vowed to stop taking drugs. During the recording session of "Civil War", Adler was unable
        to perform well due to his struggles with cocaine and heroin addiction, and his difficulties in the studio
        caused the band to do nearly 30 takes. Adler claimed at the time he was sick from taking opiate blockers to try
        to kick his addictions. Adler was fired on July 11, 1990 as a result, and later filed a lawsuit against the
        band. Adler recalled the reason for the lawsuit and recapped his firing in a 2005 interview:</p>
    <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <p>Doug Goldstein called me into the office about two weeks later. He wanted me to sign some contracts. I was
            told that every time I did heroin, the band would fine me $2,000. There was a whole stack of papers, with
            colored paper clips everywhere for my signatures. What these contracts actually said was that the band were
            paying me $2,000 to leave. They were taking my royalties, all my writing credits. They didn't like me
            anymore and just wanted me gone. That's why I filed the lawsuit - to get all those things back.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Martin Chambers (Pretenders) and Adam Maples (Sea Hags) were considered for the vacant drum position. The
        position was filled by drummer Matt Sorum, who had played briefly with The Cult. Slash credited Sorum with
        preventing the band from breaking up at the time.</p>

    <p>In response to an interviewer's suggestion that replacing Adler with Sorum had turned Guns N' Roses from a rock
        'n' roll band into a heavy metal one, Stradlin responded, "Yeah, a big musical difference. The first time I
        realized what Steve did for the band was when he broke his hand in Michigan. Tried to punch through a wall and
        busted his hand. So we had <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Coury'>Fred Coury</a> come in from Cinderella
        for the Houston show. Fred played technically good and steady, but the songs sounded just awful. They were
        written with Steve playing the drums and his sense of swing was the push and pull that give the songs their
        feel. When that was gone, it was just&#160;... unbelievable, weird. Nothing worked."</p>
    <p>A few months prior, keyboardist Dizzy Reed became the sixth member of the group when he joined as a full-time
        member. Reed was previously bandmates with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Sorum'>Matt Sorum</a> in
        Johnny Crash. The band fired its manager, Alan Niven, replacing him with Doug Goldstein in May 1991. According
        to a 1991 cover story by <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine, Rose forced the dismissal of Niven (against the wishes
        of some of his band-mates) by refusing to complete the albums until he was replaced.</p>
    <p>With enough music for two albums, the band released <i>Use Your Illusion I</i> and <i>Use Your Illusion II</i> on
        September 17, 1991. The tactic paid off when the albums debuted at No.&#160;2 and No.&#160;1 respectively in the
        Billboard charts, setting a record as the band became the only group to achieve this feat until hip-hop artist
        <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly'>Nelly</a> accomplished the same in 2004. The albums sold 770,000 units
        (<i>Use Your Illusion II</i>) and 685,000 units (<i>Use Your Illusion I</i>) in first week sales. Both albums
        spent 108 weeks on the chart. The two albums have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide, as well as 14
        million sold in the United States.</p>
    <p>Guns N' Roses accompanied the <i>Use Your Illusion</i> albums with many videos, including "Don't Cry", "November
        Rain" and "Estranged", some of the most expensive music videos ever made. The hit ballad "November Rain" (No.&#160;3
        US) became the most requested video on MTV, eventually winning the 1992 <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Award'>MTV Video Music Award</a> for best
        cinematography. It is also the longest song in US chart history to reach the Top Ten, clocking in at 8:57.
        During the awards show, the band performed the song with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John'>Elton
            John</a> accompanying on piano.</p>
    <p>Both prior to and after the release of the albums, Guns N' Roses embarked on the 28-month-long <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_Your_Illusion'>Use Your Illusion</a> Tour. It became famous for both its
        financial success and the many controversial incidents that occurred at the shows. The tour had 92 dates in 27
        countries, with over seven million people attending concerts. It is considered the 'longest tour in rock
        history'.</p>
    <h4>Use Your Illusion Tour</h4>

    <p>The Use Your Illusion World Tour program included a guitar solo from Slash based on <i>The Godfather</i> theme, a
        piano-driven cover of "It's Alright" by Black Sabbath, and an extended jam on the classic rock-inspired "Move to
        the City", where the group showcased the ensemble of musicians assembled for the tour.</p>
    <p>Many of the successful performances during the tour were overshadowed in the press by riots, late starts, and
        outspoken rants by Rose. While the band's previous drug and alcohol issues were seemingly under control, Rose
        was often agitated by lax security, sound problems, and unwanted filming or recording of the performances. He
        also used the time between songs to fire off political statements or retorts against music critics or celebrity
        rivals.</p>

    <p>On July 2, 1991, at the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverport_Amphitheater'>Riverport Amphitheater</a> in
        Maryland Heights, Missouri, just outside St. Louis, during a performance of "Rocket Queen", Rose discovered that
        a fan was filming the show with a camera. After asking the venue's security to take away the camera, Rose
        decided to take it himself, jumping into the audience and tackling the fan. He had a heated confrontation with
        the fan before physically assaulting him. After being pulled out of the audience by members of the crew, Rose
        said, "Well, thanks to the lame-ass security, I'm going home!", threw his microphone to the ground and stormed
        off the stage. The angry crowd rioted, injuring dozens. Footage was captured by Robert John, who was documenting
        the entire tour. Rose was wanted by the police for inciting the riot, but police were unable to arrest him until
        almost a year later, as the band went overseas to continue the tour. Charges were filed against Rose, but a
        judge ruled that he did not directly incite the riot. In his defense, Rose stated that the Guns N' Roses
        security team had made four separate requests to the venue's security staff to remove the camera, all of which
        were ignored, and that other members of the band had reported being hit by bottles launched from the audience,
        while the security staff was refusing to enforce a drinking limit. As a result, <i>Use Your Illusion's</i> liner
        notes featured a hidden message amidst the <i>Thank You</i> section: "Fuck You, St. Louis!"</p>

    <p>Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin abruptly quit the band on November 7, 1991, after a repeat of the St. Louis
        incident nearly unfolded during a concert in Germany. Stradlin cited a combination of Rose's personal behavior,
        his mismanagement of the band, and difficulties being around Slash, Sorum, and McKagan, due to his new-found
        sobriety and their continuing alcohol and substance addictions. Stradlin later commented, "Once I quit drugs, I
        couldn't help looking around and asking myself, 'Is this all there is?' I was just tired of it; I needed to get
        out." Slash commented on finding a replacement, saying, "When Izzy left, we realized that we either had to find
        a new guitarist in three weeks or cancel a bunch of gigs. I had a piece of paper with about 30-odd candidates
        listed. Duff was looking around and Axl had his ideas, but nobody seemed right. For a while it looked like <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Navarro'>Dave Navarro</a> from Jane's <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction'>Addiction</a> was going to join, but he couldn't get it
        together, so that never happened." Stradlin was eventually replaced by Los Angeles-based guitarist Gilby Clarke,
        whom Slash credited for saving the band.</p>
    <p>During many shows throughout the tour, Rose introduced Clarke to the audience, and Slash and Clarke would then
        play "Wild Horses", a Rolling Stones cover. In late 1991, the band added a touring ensemble, which included a
        horns section and several background vocalists. In 1992, Clarke broke his arm in a motorcycle accident during
        the tour, and was replaced for several weeks by Stradlin.</p>
    <p>In 1992, the band appeared at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, performing a three-song set. Because of the
        controversial song "One in a Million", activist group <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_UP'>ACT UP</a>
        demanded that the band be dropped from the bill, and urged other artists to shun the group and the crowd to boo
        it. Members of Queen dismissed the activists, with guitarist <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_May'>Brian
            May</a> stating "People seem so blind. Don't they realize that the mere fact that Guns N' Roses are here is
        the biggest statement that you could get?" Slash later performed "Tie Your Mother Down" with the remaining
        members of Queen and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Def_Leppard'>Def Leppard</a> vocalist Joe Elliott, while
        Rose performed "We Will Rock You" and sang a duet with Elton John on "Bohemian Rhapsody". Their personal set
        included "Paradise City" and "Knockin' on Heaven's Door". When the band returned to the US for the second leg of
        the Use Your Illusion Tour, Brian May opened the shows with The Brian May Band. Rose had originally wanted the
        grunge band (and Geffen labelmates) Nirvana to open the band's Use Your Illusion Tour, but frontman <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain'>Kurt Cobain</a> refused.</p>
    <p>Later in the year, Guns N' Roses went on the Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour, with American metal band
        Metallica, being supported by Faith No More, Mot&#246;rhead, and Body Count. During a show in August 1992 at
        Montreal's Olympic Stadium, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica'>Metallica</a> frontman <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hetfield'>James Hetfield</a> suffered second degree burns to his
        hands and face after malfunctions with a pyrotechnics blast. Metallica was forced to cancel the second hour of
        the show, but promised to return to the city for another performance. After a long delay, during which the
        audience became increasingly restless, Guns N' Roses took the stage. However, the shortened time between sets
        did not allow for adequate tuning of stage monitors, resulting in members of G&#160;N'&#160;R not being able to
        hear themselves. In addition, Rose claimed that his throat hurt, causing the band to leave the stage early. The
        cancellation led to another audience riot, with three police officers and 10 rioters injured. Police made at
        least a dozen arrests related to the incident.</p>
    <p>The pyro incident and riot can be seen on video in <i>A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica</i>. In a
        segment on the video, Hetfield mocked Rose and read his personal tour rider, making fun of various items on the
        list. Rose responded by addressing the crowd during a later concert, labeling Hetfield a racist for his decision
        to pull <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Count'>Body Count</a> from the tour, and called him a 'stupid
        little cocksucker' while bashing the rest of the band. On VH1's <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_the_Music'>Behind the Music</a> documentary about Metallica,
        Ulrich stated that "We couldn't relate to Axl and his attitude." Other members of Metallica and Rose himself
        both stated that the two groups 'never really gelled'.</p>
    <p>In mid-1993, former drummer Steven Adler's lawsuit against the band was settled out of court; Adler received a
        back-payment check of $2,250,000 and 15% royalties for songs he recorded.</p>
    <p>The <i>Use Your Illusion</i> tour ended in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on July 17, 1993. The tour set attendance
        records and lasted for 28 months, in which 194 shows were played. The show in <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires'>Buenos Aires</a> marked the last time that Sorum and
        Clarke would play a live show with Rose. It was also the last time Slash performed with Rose until rejoining the
        band in 2016.</p>
    <h4><i>"The Spaghetti Incident?"</i></h4>


    <p>On November 23, 1993, Guns N' Roses released a collection of punk and glam rock covers entitled <i>"The Spaghetti
        Incident?"</i> Izzy Stradlin's recorded guitar parts were replaced by Gilby Clarke. Many of the tracks were
        recorded during the same sessions as the <i>Illusions</i> albums, which were originally intended to produce 3 or
        4 albums. Initially, the band was going to release a covers EP in 1992 or 1993, but decided on making a full
        album and recorded more songs. Bassist Duff McKagan sings on many of the album's tracks and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi_Rocks'>Hanoi Rocks</a> frontman <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Monroe'>Michael Monroe</a> appears on "Ain't It Fun" as a guest
        vocalist. Slash described the recording of the album as "spontaneous and unpainted". The title of the album is
        an inside joke referring to a food fight that occurred between <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Axl_Rose'>Axl
            Rose</a> and Steven Adler. During his lawsuit against the band, Adler's attorney described the food fight as
        "the Spaghetti Incident". The meaning was explained by drummer Matt Sorum in a 1994 interview with <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Much_Music'>Much Music</a> and confirmed by Slash in his autobiography,
        <i>Slash</i>.</p>
    <p>An unadvertised cover of the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Manson'>Charles Manson</a> song "Look at
        Your Game, Girl" was included on the album. The track was kept secret, and was not included on advance tapes
        sent out to reviewers. Band manager Doug Goldstein stated "There is a bonus track on the album, but Axl wants it
        to speak for itself," and that "It wasn't done for the critics or anybody else. It was a bonus for the fans."
        The inclusion of the song caused controversy, with law-enforcement and victims-rights groups expressing outrage.
    </p>
    <p>Rose claimed "the reason we didn't list that song on our album is we wanted to downplay it. We don't give any
        credit to Charles Manson on the album; it's like a hidden bonus truck [<i>sic</i>]." The band considered
        removing the song from new pressings of the album, and David Geffen stated in a phone interview, "I would hope
        that if Axl Rose had realized how offensive people would find this, he would not have ever recorded this song in
        the first place. The fact that Charles Manson would be earning money based on the fame he derived committing one
        of the most horrific crimes of the 20th Century is unthinkable to me". Slash mentioned that the song was "done
        with naive and innocent black humor on our part". Rose stated he would donate all performance royalties from the
        song to a nonprofit environmental organization. Slash stated that the group intended to remove the song before
        the band decided to keep it after learning that royalties from the song would be donated to the Bartek
        Frykowski, the son of Wojciech Frykowski, a victim of Manson during the Tate Murders. Geffen Records released a
        statement mentioning that the label's share of royalties would be donated to the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Tate'>Doris Tate</a> Crime Victims Bureau. Years later, Rose said
        the song would be removed from new pressings of the album, claiming that critics and the media had
        misinterpreted his interest in Manson. Rose can be seen wearing a Manson shirt in the video for "Estranged" and
        during a concert in Milton Keynes, England, in 1993. Rose explained wearing the shirt as "trying to make a
        statement" because "a lot of people enjoy playing me as the bad guy and the crazy. Sorry, I'm not that guy. I'm
        nothing like him." Despite the statement that the track would be removed, "Look at Your Game, Girl" is still
        featured on pressings of the album.</p>
    <p>The album debuted at number 4 on the Billboard charts, and sold 190,000 copies its first week. Despite initial
        success, <i>"The Spaghetti Incident?"</i> did not match the sales of the <i>Illusion</i> albums and its release
        consequently led to increased tension within the band.</p>

    <h3>Member departures and sporadic activity (1994&#8211;1999)</h3>
    <p>Interviews with Guns N' Roses band members suggest that between 1994 and 1996, the band sporadically began to
        write and record new material, most of which, according to Slash, had been written by Rose. Rose has stated the
        exact opposite in the open letter on the official Guns N' Roses website in 2008, saying that the album was
        mostly a "Slash album" and Rose was allowed very little input into the album. According to Matt Sorum, in 1996,
        the band had recorded 7 songs, with 7 more in the writing stages, and intended to release a single album with 10
        or 12 songs, with a release date of Spring 1997. Sorum also mentioned that Slash's Snakepit's debut album, <i>It's
            Five O'Clock Somewhere</i>, "could have been a Guns N' Roses album, but Axl didn't think it was good
        enough."</p>

    <p>In May 1994, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilby_Clarke'>Gilby Clarke</a> mentioned in an interview that
        there was "no 'next' Guns N' Roses album" adding, "We started working on one, and it got canned." Sorum
        described the would-be album as "not as sophisticated as Illusion, but not as wild as Appetite". The album was
        also described as consisting of "up-tempo rock songs" with "no ballads", according to Duff McKagan. In a 2002
        interview, Rose complimented the guitar work Slash had layed down, saying it was the "best playing [he's] done
        at least since Illusions". Rose mentioned the material was scrapped due to the lack of collaboration between
        band members. He later told <i>USA Today</i> in a 2012 interview that he didn't write any music "for years" in
        the mid-1990s because of criticism from bandmates Slash and Duff McKagan, as well as ex-fiancee Stephanie
        Seymour.</p>
    <p>In January 1994, Rose inducted Elton John into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and later that night performed a
        duet with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen'>Bruce Springsteen</a> on a cover of <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles'>The Beatles</a> song "Come Together". It was Rose's final
        public performance for six years. Also in 1994, all of the members of the band at the time contributed to Gilby
        Clarke's debut album, <i>Pawnshop Guitars</i>.</p>
    <p>In December 1994, Guns N' Roses released a cover recording of the Rolling Stones' "Sympathy for the Devil". The
        song appeared in the films <i>Interview with the Vampire</i> and <i>Fallen</i>. The song was also released
        separately as a single. <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly'>Entertainment Weekly</a> stated
        that the 'note-for-note remake works up a decent lather but seems utterly bankrupt'. It is the final Guns N'
        Roses track to feature Slash on lead guitar, Duff McKagan on bass, and Matt Sorum on drums. The song also
        featured Rose's childhood friend and Hollywood Rose collaborator Paul "Huge" Tobias on rhythm guitar. Tobias's
        presence on the track and in the band created tension, reportedly Slash had '(both) creative and personal
        differences' with Tobias. A 2001 interview revealed Slash told his bandmates in September 1996, "I'm going to
        confront it. Either Paul goes, or [I go]."</p>

    <p>Gilby Clarke's contract was not renewed and he was gone from the band by 1995. Slash stated in his book that Rose
        fired Clarke without consulting anyone, claiming he was only a "hired hand". Clarke was not involved in the
        recording of 'Sympathy for the Devil', stating "I knew that that was the ending [of Clarke's involvement in Guns
        N' Roses] because nobody told me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song
        without me". Clarke also mentioned that before the final show of the <i>Use Your Illusion Tour</i>, Rose came up
        to him and told him "Hey, enjoy your last show". Clarke later sued the band over the use of his likeness in Guns
        N' Roses Pinball.</p>
    <p>In 1996, Rose, Slash, McKagan, and former member Izzy Stradlin all appeared as guests on <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outpatience'>The Outpatience</a> debut album Anxious Disease, a band
        featuring Guns N' Roses collaborator West Arkeen.</p>
    <p>The recording of "Sympathy for the Devil", as well as tension between him and Rose, led Slash to quit the band
        officially in October 1996. Rose sent a fax notifying MTV of Slash's departure, with Slash responding "Axl and I
        have not been capable of seeing eye to eye on Guns N' Roses for some time. We tried to collaborate, but at this
        point, I'm no longer in the band." Slash also stated, "Axl's whole visionary style, as far as his input in Guns
        N' Roses, is completely different from mine. I just like to play guitar, write a good riff, go out there and
        play, as opposed to presenting an image."</p>
    <p>Slash was replaced by <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails'>Nine Inch Nails</a> touring guitarist
        <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Finck'>Robin Finck</a> in January 1997, who signed a two-year contract
        with the band in August 1997, making him an official member. Finck was originally recommended by Matt Sorum to
        Rose a year earlier as a possible second guitarist to complement Slash. Slash's departure was followed shortly
        thereafter by Matt Sorum in April 1997, who was fired by Rose after getting in an argument about Tobias's
        inclusion in the band. Sorum later stated Tobias was the "Yoko Ono of Guns N' Roses". McKagan was the last of
        the <i>Appetite</i> lineup to leave, resigning as bassist in August 1997. McKagan had recently become a father
        and wrote about his decision to leave in his autobiography, stating "Guns had been paying rent on studios for
        three years now&#8212;from 1994 to 1997&#8212;and still did not have a single song. The whole operation was so
        erratic that it didn't seem to fit with my hopes for parenthood, for stability." McKagan was replaced later that
        year by former Replacements bassist Tommy Stinson. An actual break-up of Guns N' Roses never occurred, as new
        players were brought in as the old ones left. Rose reportedly purchased the full rights to the Guns N' Roses
        name in 1997. Slash claimed he and bandmates signed over the name in duress, stating "Axl refused to go onstage
        one night during the Use Your Illusion tour in 1992 unless the band signed away the name rights to the band.
        Unfortunately, we signed it. I didn't think he'd on stage otherwise." Rose denied the claim, saying "(it) Never
        happened, all made up, fallacy and fantasy. Not one single solitary thread of truth to it. Had that been the
        case I would've have been cremated years ago legally, could've cleaned me out for the name and damages. It's
        called under duress with extenuating circumstances."</p>
    <p>Rose auditioned multiple potential band members, including Chris Vrenna, Zakk Wylde, Dave Abbruzzese, and Michael
        Bland. <i>Rolling Stone</i> reported in April 1997 that the lineup of Guns N' Roses was Rose, McKagan, Tobias,
        Finck &amp; Vrenna.</p>
    <p>Josh Freese was ultimately hired to replace Sorum on drums, joining in the summer of 1997. By the end of 1998, a
        new version of Guns N' Roses had emerged: vocalist Axl Rose, bassist Tommy Stinson, drummer Josh Freese, lead
        guitarist Robin Finck, rhythm guitarist Paul Tobias, keyboardist Dizzy Reed, and multi-instrumentalist Chris
        Pitman.</p>
    <p>Geffen released an edited single disc version of the <i>Illusion</i> albums in 1998, entitled <i>Use Your
        Illusion</i>. In November 1999, the label released <i>Live Era '87&#8211;'93</i>, a collection of live
        performances from various concerts during the <i>Appetite for Destruction</i> and <i>Use Your Illusion</i>
        tours. Former guitarist Slash described the selection of songs of the album as a "very mutual effort", further
        adding "the live album was one of the easiest projects we all worked on. I didn't actually see Axl, but we
        communicated via the powers that be."</p>

    <h3>The "new" Guns N' Roses and <i>Chinese Democracy</i> (1999&#8211;2008)</h3>

    <p>A new Guns N' Roses album had reportedly been in the works since 1994, with Rose the only original member still
        in the band. <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby'>Moby</a> was reported to be producing with Guns N' Roses
        in 1997, with work that sources described as "sounding different from the sound you know&#160;... definitely
        electronic influenced." Mike Clink, who had previously produced every Guns N' Roses album, was also attached to
        produce in May 1997. In April 1998, Moby was replaced by Youth, and the album was still in the writing stages.
        In July 1998, journalist <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Strauss'>Neil Strauss</a> indicated that an
        'electronica influenced' album by a new Guns N' Roses lineup was due in 1999. <i>Rolling Stone</i> stated that
        the label planned for the album to be released in late 1999. By August 1999, the band had recorded over 30 songs
        for the album, tentatively titled <i>2000 Intentions</i>. September 1999 saw Youth being replaced by producer
        Sean Beaven.</p>
    <p>In November 1999, during an interview with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Loder'>Kurt Loder</a> for MTV,
        Rose said that he had re-recorded <i>Appetite for Destruction</i> with the then-new band, apart from two songs
        which he had replaced with "Patience" and "You Could Be Mine". During the interview, Rose announced the title of
        the upcoming album <i>Chinese Democracy</i>, stating:</p>
    <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <p>There's a lot of Chinese democracy movements, and it's something that there's a lot of talk about, and it's
            something that will be nice to see. It could also just be like an ironic statement. I don't know, I just
            like the sound of it. (The album has) a lot of different sounds. There's some heavy songs, there's a lot of
            aggressive songs, but they're all in different styles and different sounds. It is truly a melting pot.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Band manager Doug Goldstein stated in November 1999 that the band had 'almost finished' recording the music, and
        the album was due out some time in 2000. Later that month, the band released a new song, the industrial styled
        "Oh My God", which was included on the soundtrack of the film <i>End of Days</i>. The track featured additional
        guitar work by Dave Navarro and Gary Sunshine, Rose's personal guitar teacher. Rose claimed that former members
        Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum had 'failed to see the potential' of the song and had no interest in recording or
        playing the piece.</p>

    <p>In August 1999, guitarist Robin Finck departed to rejoin his former band, Nine Inch Nails, on tour. In March
        2000, avant-garde guitarist Brian Carroll, more commonly referred to as Buckethead, joined Guns N' Roses as a
        replacement for Finck. Also in March 2000, drummer <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Freese'>Josh
            Freese</a> left the band, being replaced with Bryan "Brain" Mantia (formerly of Primus). Mantia, a childhood
        friend of Carroll's, had previously worked with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckethead'>Buckethead</a> in
        several bands, including Praxis. Robin Finck returned to the band in late 2000, to complement Buckethead on lead
        guitar. Queen guitarist Brian May and former Queen producer <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Thomas_Baker'>Roy Thomas Baker</a> worked with the band in 2000.
        With the album nearing completion in mid-2000, Baker convinced Rose to re-record the entire album, causing
        further delays.</p>
    <p>In an interview with <i>Rolling Stone</i> in February 2000, Rose played several songs of the upcoming album to
        reporters, including "Chinese Democracy", "Catcher in the Rye", "I.R.S.", "The Blues", "There was a Time" and
        "Oklahoma". Rose mentioned that part of the delay of the new album was him 'educating himself about the
        technology that's come to define rock', stating that "it's like from scratch, learning how to work with
        something, and not wanting it just to be something you did on a computer." <i>Rolling Stone</i> described the
        album as "Led Zeppelin's <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Graffiti'>Physical Graffiti</a> remixed by
        <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck'>Beck</a> and Trent Reznor. Rose mentioned that the expense of the
        record would be negated by the recording sessions yielding multiple albums, including a record that is "more
        industrial and electronica-influenced than Chinese Democracy". At that point, the album had gone through
        multiple producers, including Youth, Moby, Mike Clink, Roy Thomas Baker, Eric Caudieux. At the time, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Beavan'>Sean Beavan</a> was producing, but Caram Costanzo and Axl
        Rose became the final credited producers on the album. The album had been completely re-recorded several times
        with varying musicians and producers. In a 2001 interview, Rose described the album as having "all kinds of
        styles, many influences as blues, mixed in the songs" and said that it was "not industrial".</p>
    <p>Describing why he continued using the Guns N' Roses name, instead of labeling the upcoming album an 'Axl Rose
        solo album', Rose stated "It is something I lived by before these guys were in it. And there were other people
        in Guns n' Roses before them, you know. I contemplated letting go of that, but it doesn't feel right in any way.
        I am not the person who chose to try to kill it and walked away. It's not an Axl Rose album, even if it's what I
        wanted it to be. Everybody is putting everything they've got into singing and building. Maybe I'm helping steer
        it to what it should be built like." Also in the interview, Rose attributed the breakup of the old lineup to
        drug addictions and 'an effort from inside the band to destroy him', stating "There was an effort to bring me
        down. It was a king-of-the-mountain thing," and that he "needed to take control to survive". Rose also described
        the dissolution as "a divorce".</p>
    <p>Jim Barber, a former A&amp;R executive with Geffen stated that the new album "reminded me of the best moments of
        Seventies <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd'>Pink Floyd</a> or later Led Zeppelin. There's nothing
        out there right now that has that kind of scope. Axl hasn't spent the last several years struggling to write Use
        Your Illusion over again."</p>
    <p>Eight years after the previous Guns N' Roses concert, the band made a public appearance in January 2001 with two
        well-received concerts: one in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas'>Las Vegas</a> and one at the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_in_Rio'>Rock in Rio</a> Festival in Rio de Janeiro. The band played
        both songs from previous albums and songs from then-unreleased <i>Chinese Democracy</i>. During the band's Rock
        in Rio set, Rose made the following comment regarding former members of the band:</p>
    <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <p>I know that many of you are disappointed that some of the people you came to know and love could not be with
            us here today. Regardless of what you have heard or read, people worked very hard (meaning my former
            friends) to do everything they could so that I could not be here today. I am as hurt and disappointed as you
            that unlike Oasis, we could not find a way to all get along.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The group played a further two shows in Las Vegas at the end of 2001. Former guitarist Slash claimed that he
        tried to attend a show and was turned away at the door by security. Due to his frustrations with touring, rhythm
        guitarist <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tobias'>Paul Tobias</a> left the band in 2001 and was replaced
        by Richard Fortus (formerly of <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Psychedelic_Furs'>The Psychedelic Furs</a>
        and Love Spit Love). Producer Roy Thomas Baker was fired in February 2002. <i>Drudge Report</i> reported in June
        2002 that <i>Chinese Democracy</i> was scheduled for a September 2, 2002 release.</p>
    <p>The band then played several shows in August 2002, headlining festivals and concerts throughout Asia and Europe,
        including Pukkelpop, Summer Sonic Festival, and The Carling Weekend. At the 2002 <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Awards'>MTV Video Music Awards</a> on August 29, 2002,
        Guns N' Roses closed the show in a previously unannounced performance, playing Welcome to the Jungle,
        Madagascar, and Paradise City.</p>
    <p>In November 2002, the band's first North American tour since 1993 was organized to support <i>Chinese
        Democracy</i>, with CKY and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix_Master_Mike'>Mix Master Mike</a> joining.
        However, the opening show in Vancouver was canceled by the venue when Rose failed to turn up. According to Guns'
        management, "Axl's flight from L.A. had been delayed by mechanical troubles". A riot ensued. This tour was met
        with mixed results. Some concerts did not sell well, while shows in larger markets such as New York City sold
        out in minutes. Due to a second riot by fans in <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia'>Philadelphia</a> when the band failed to show up again,
        tour promoter <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_Channel'>Clear Channel</a> canceled the remainder of the
        tour. Rose later mentioned in 2006, "There are reasons that I have not spoken more about [cancelled shows in
        Vancouver and Philadelphia] that have been extremely complicated and are not legally resolved behind the scenes
        to this day and could have possibly jeopardized the future of Guns N' Roses." Rose then apologized to the city
        of Philadelphia when playing there in 2012, adding "I'm not saying I'm innocent".</p>

    <p>The band went on hiatus until it was scheduled to play at Rock in Rio Lisboa in May 2004. However, Buckethead
        left the band in March of that year, causing the band to cancel. Buckethead reportedly left the band because of
        the "inability to complete an album or tour", according to his manager. Rose claimed "the band has been put in
        an untenable position by guitarist Buckethead and his untimely departure. During his tenure with the band,
        Buckethead has been inconsistent and erratic in both his behavior and commitment, despite being under contract,
        creating uncertainty and confusion and making it virtually impossible to move forward with recording, rehearsals
        and live plans with confidence. His transient lifestyle has made it impossible for even his closest friends to
        have nearly any form of communication with him whatsoever."</p>
    <p>That same month, Geffen released Guns N' Roses' <i>Greatest Hits</i>, since Rose had failed to deliver a new
        studio album in more than ten years. Slash and McKagan joined Rose in suing Geffen to stop the release of the
        album, which was compiled without authorization from any current or former band members. The lawsuit was thrown
        out and the album went triple platinum in the US, eventually going on to be the third longest charting album in
        the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_SoundScan'>Nielsen SoundScan</a> era. McKagan and Slash also
        joined Rose in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the release of The Roots of Guns N' Roses.</p>
    <p>By 2005, Geffen had taken <i>Chinese Democracy</i> off of its release schedule and pulled funding, stating
        "Having exceeded all budgeted and approved recording costs by millions of dollars, it is Mr. Rose's obligation
        to fund and complete the album, not Geffen's." Around then, manager Merck Mercuriadis stated that "The 'Chinese
        Democracy' album is very close to being completed". According to a 2005 report by <i>The New York Times</i>,
        Rose had allegedly spent $13 million in the studio by that point. Mercuriadis rejected the budget claims made by
        the <i>New York Times</i> article and claimed that the newspaper's sources had not been involved with the
        project for "six to nine years". The $13 million makes the album the most expensive rock album ever produced.
    </p>
    <p>In February 2006, demos of the songs "Better", "Catcher in the Rye", "I.R.S.", and "There Was a Time" were leaked
        on to the Internet through a Guns N' Roses fan site. The band's management requested that all links to the MP3
        files and all lyrics to the songs be removed from forums and websites. Despite this, radio stations began adding
        "I.R.S." to playlists, and the song reached No.&#160;49 on the Radio &amp; Records Active Rock National Airplay
        chart in the final week of February.</p>
    <p>In August 2006, Slash and McKagan sued Rose over Guns N' Roses publishing and songwriting credits, which Rose's
        lawyer claimed were due to a 'clerical error' while changing publishers.</p>

    <p>After a recommendation by guitar virtuoso Joe Satriani, guitarist Ron "Bumblefoot" Thal was contacted by
        keyboardist <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pitman'>Chris Pitman</a> in 2004. After sending demos and
        jamming with the band, Thal officially joined Guns N' Roses in 2006, replacing Buckethead. Thal made his live
        debut with the band at the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerstein_Ballroom'>Hammerstein Ballroom</a> in
        New York City on May 12, 2006, the band's first live show in over three years.</p>
    <p>Five warm-up shows before a North American tour were held in September 2006. The tour officially commenced on
        October 24 in Miami. Drummer <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Ferrer'>Frank Ferrer</a> replaced Bryan
        Mantia, who took a leave of absence to be with his wife and newborn child. Ferrer had previously worked with
        Richard Fortus in the Psychedelic Furs and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Spit_Love'>Love Spit Love</a>
        (and had been a member of several other bands, including The Beautiful). Coinciding with the tour, the song
        "Better" was featured in an internet advertisement for <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley-Davidson'>Harley-Davidson</a>
        in October 2006. Keyboardist Dizzy Reed stated that the release was an accident, with two versions being made,
        one 'experimental edit' featuring a demo of Better and one with Paradise City. The ad with Better was mislabeled
        and inadvertently uploaded online for a day before being replaced by the intended ad with Paradise City. That
        same month, <i>Rolling Stone</i> published an article revealing that Andy Wallace would be mixing the final
        album. In November 2006 shows in Portland, Maine, were cancelled, with the band claiming it was "due to
        limitations imposed by local fire marshals". Rose later apologized in a statement, stating "We have chosen to
        take the public heat for these events in order to have another shot at the future today with a new album."</p>
    <p>In December 2006, Rose released an open letter to fans announcing that Merck Mercuriadis had been fired as the
        band's manager. He revealed that the last four dates of the North American tour would be cut so the band could
        work on post-production for <i>Chinese Democracy</i>. He also set a tentative release date for the album for the
        first time since the album's announcement: March 6, 2007.</p>
    <p>On February 23, 2007, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_James'>Del James</a> announced that the recording
        stage of <i>Chinese Democracy</i> was finished, and the band had now moved onto mixing the album, mentioning
        "After some delays and scheduling difficulties, things appear to be moving along." However, this proved that the
        March 6 release date would be impossible to achieve, and the album once again had no scheduled release date. In
        a December 2007 interview, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Bach'>Sebastian Bach</a> claimed Rose
        had planned to have the album released by Christmas 2007: "I know Axl was very serious about putting something
        out before Christmas. He was talking to me about it. He was talking about finishing liner notes." Bach also said
        that <i>Chinese Democracy'</i>s delay might be because of business problems: "I think there's a lot of business
        shit that goes on with him. It's just not as easy. It's a little more complicated than people think."</p>
    <p>Also in February 2007, the 'final' version of "Better" leaked online to positive reviews. On May 4, 2007, three
        more tracks leaked from <i>Chinese Democracy</i>; an updated version of "I.R.S.", "The Blues" and the title
        track. All three tracks had previously been played live. Guns N' Roses embarked on the 2007 leg of the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Democracy'>Chinese Democracy</a> World Tour in Mexico in June,
        followed by dates in Australia and Japan. The songs "Nice Boys" and "Don't Cry" (appearing as an instrumental
        Bumblefoot solo) were played for the first time since the Use Your Illusion Tour. The tour ended on the
        twentieth anniversary of <i>Appetite for Destruction'</i>s release date, in Osaka. During this tour, the band
        featured vocalist Axl Rose, Robin Finck, Ron Thal and Richard Fortus on guitars, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Stinson'>Tommy Stinson</a> on bass, Dizzy Reed and Chris Pitman on
        keyboards and Frank Ferrer on drums.</p>

    <p>Rumors arose that <i>Chinese Democracy</i> had been handed over to Geffen Records, but had been delayed because
        the label and Rose could not agree on the marketing of the album in early 2008. <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Trunk'>Eddie Trunk</a> also claimed Geffen might have the album:
        "I hear the new GNR CD is actually done, but the delay in release is not the bands [<i>sic</i>] issues but the
        label. There is so much money tied up in this record that in todays [<i>sic</i>] business it will be virtually
        impossible to be profitable, meaning the label might want to sell it off but can not [<i>sic</i>] find a buyer
        since nobody buys CDs anymore. Problem might not be Axl this time around and might keep this CD in limbo for
        more years to come. Hopefully it gets resolved." However, in a February 2008 interview with <i>Classic Rock
            Magazine</i>, Rose's manager, Beta Lebeis, debunked Trunk's suggestion and stated the band is "in
        negotiations" with the record label, and the album had been finished since Christmas 2007.</p>
    <p>On March 26, 2008, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Pepper'>Dr Pepper</a> announced a plan to give everyone
        in America &#8211; except the band's former guitarists Slash and Buckethead &#8211; a free can of Dr Pepper if
        the band released <i>Chinese Democracy</i> before the end of 2008. Rose stated he was "surprised and very happy"
        about the announcement, adding, "As some of Buckethead's performances are on our album, I'll share my Dr Pepper
        with him." With the announcement from Guns N' Roses regarding a release date in November, Tony Jacobs, Dr
        Pepper's Vice President of Marketing for Dr. Pepper, announced a free soda coupon campaign for 24 hours on
        Sunday, November 23, 2008. However, due to "heavy volume" on the server throughout the entire day, it was
        impossible to submit for a free coupon.</p>
    <p>On March 27, 2008, the day after Dr Pepper's announcement, the band members announced that they had hired a new
        management team, headed by <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Azoff'>Irving Azoff</a> and Andy Gould. The
        band later condemned Dr. Pepper for the failed promotion. In a letter to Dr Pepper, Rose's lawyer Alan Gutman
        said "The redemption scheme your company clumsily implemented for this offer was an unmitigated disaster which
        defrauded consumers and, in the eyes of vocal fans, ruined <i>Chinese Democracy'</i>s release." Rose's lawyer
        also demanded that the company make a full-page apology that would appear in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>USA
            Today</i>, <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>. In a 2009 interview, Rose stated he
        specifically told his lawyers it was a non-issue and was taken off-guard by their actions, believing they should
        be focused on the record release.</p>
    <p>Amidst industry rumors in April 2008 that a release was coming soon, nine tracks purported to be from <i>Chinese
        Democracy</i> were leaked to a website on June 19, 2008, but were quickly removed due to a cease-and-desist
        letter from the band's label. Six of the leaked tracks had surfaced previously in some form, while three were
        new. The leaked songs were more fleshed out than previously heard tracks. On July 14, 2008, Harmonix, in
        conjunction with MTV Games, officially announced the release of a new song from the upcoming <i>Chinese
            Democracy</i> album, called "Shackler's Revenge", through the new game <i>Rock Band 2</i>. The entire album
        was eventually added to the game as DLC in April 2009. The song "If the World" debuted October 10, 2008, playing
        in the end credits of the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott'>Ridley Scott</a> film Body of Lies.
    </p>
    <p>In late August, speculation about the impending release of the album resurfaced, further fueled by separate
        reports from both <i>Rolling Stone</i> and <i>Billboard</i> about a November 25 release date as a <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy'>Best Buy</a> exclusive. This was finally confirmed October 22
        when band management, Best Buy, and Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records officially issued a joint press release
        confirming the much anticipated release of the album in the US on November 23 as a Best Buy exclusive. Several
        days before its official release, the band streamed the entire <i>Chinese Democracy</i> album on the group's
        Myspace page. The album was streamed over 3 million times, breaking the Myspace record for most streamed album
        ever.</p>
    <p><i>Chinese Democracy</i>, the band's sixth studio album and its first since 1993's <i>"The Spaghetti
        Incident?"</i>, was released on November 22, 2008, in Europe and Australia, in North America on November 23,
        2008, and in the United Kingdom on November 24, 2008. The album had an estimated $14 million in production
        costs, making it the most expensive rock album to ever be produced in music history. It debuted at No.&#160;3 on
        the <i>Billboard</i> 200 but undersold industry expectations, despite generally positive critical reception.</p>

    <h3>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, touring and Appetite for Democracy (2009&#8211;2014)</h3>
    <p>In an MTV phone interview with Kurt Loder in 1999, Rose said he and the then-new band had recorded enough
        material for a double album. In an informal chat with <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine in February 2006, Rose
        stated the band had 32 songs in the works. While appearing on various fan message boards in December 2008, Rose
        stated several working titles of songs for a possible future album. Among the working titles were: "Elvis
        Presley and the Monster of Soul" ("Soul Monster", formerly known as "Leave Me Alone"), "Atlas Shrugged",
        "Seven", "The General", "Thyme", "Ides of March", "Berlin" (formerly "Oklahoma"), "Zodiac", "Quick Song", and
        "Down by the Ocean" (co-written by original member Izzy Stradlin). During the chat, he mentioned the bridge of
        "Soul Monster" as the band's "most Black Sabbath" moment, and referred to it as "the meanest section of anything
        I've sung to date." In a 2007 interview, Rose's close friend Sebastian Bach stated "The General" had a "heavy"
        sound with "screaming vocals" and also said it was the sequel to the 1991 classic ballad "Estranged" from the
        album <i>Use Your Illusion II</i>. Bach also remarked that <i>Chinese Democracy</i> would be the first
        installment in a trilogy of new albums, and that Rose had told him the third, as yet untitled, album had been
        slated for 2012, although the year ended without seeing a release past Chinese Democracy. The initial plan for
        <i>Chinese Democracy</i> in 2001 was to record two albums, release Chinese Democracy, tour for a year or two,
        then release the second album without having to return to the studio.</p>
    <p>Former drummer <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Mantia'>Bryan Mantia</a> mentioned working on a 'club
        remix' of <i>Shackler's Revenge</i>, stating that Rose planned to put out a remix album of songs from Chinese
        Democracy. Guitarist <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Ashba'>DJ Ashba</a> has said that the next album is
        being discussed, stating that the band "has been throwing around a bunch of ideas" and joked that the next album
        "won't take as long" to release. On April 20, 2011, Ashba said in an interview at the <i>Revolver</i> Golden
        Gods Awards that Guns N' Roses have been "working on new songs every day". In an interview with reporter Nui Te
        Koha on <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_M'>Triple M</a> Melbourne's <i>The Hot Breakfast</i>, Ashba
        talked about songs Rose has written, stating: "Axl has a lot of great songs up his sleeve. He probably has three
        albums worth of stuff recorded. The stuff I've heard&#160;... I've been up in his hotel room many nights and he
        just sits down at the piano and plays. I'm like 'this is amazing, people have to hear this song' and he's like
        "ah, this is something I'm tinkering on'."</p>
    <p>On February 6, 2009, Rose gave his first interview in nine years when he sat down with <i>Billboard'</i>s
        Jonathan Cohen. Rose said that there was no chance that he would ever agree with a reunion with Slash:</p>
    <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <p>What's clear is that one of the two of us will die before a reunion and however sad, ugly or unfortunate
            anyone views it, it is how it is. Those decisions were made a long time ago and reiterated year after year
            by one man.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Rose was, however, open to working again with Stradlin and McKagan (both of whom he has worked with since the
        interview took place):</p>
    <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <p>I could see doing a song or so on the side with Izzy or having him out [on tour] again. I'm not so
            comfortable with doing anything having more than one of the alumni. Maybe something with Duff, but that's
            it, and not something I'd have to really get down into, as I'd get left with sorting it out and then blamed
            on top of it. So, no, not me.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In early March 2009, industry insiders speculated Guns N' Roses would launch a summer stadium tour, which
        eventually would become the Chinese Democracy World Tour 2009/2010. Later that month, the band announced that DJ
        Ashba would be the new lead guitarist, replacing a departing Robin Finck, who rejoined Nine Inch Nails. Ashba
        had previously played with former drummer Steven Adler in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/BulletBoys'>BulletBoys</a>
        in 1998.</p>
    <p>In June 2009, it was reported that manager Irving Azoff had been 'fired, then re-hired, then fired'. A year
        later, Azoff's company Front Line Management sued Rose, claiming he "violated an oral agreement to pay 15% of
        earnings, or nearly $2 million, from a lucrative concert tour", seeking 1.87 million in unpaid fees. Rose filed
        a $5 million counter-lawsuit against Azoff, saying that Azoff sabotaged sales of Guns N' Roses' comeback album
        and lied about a potential "super tour" with Van Halen, a band managed by Azoff, as part of a plan to force Rose
        to reunite with his estranged former band members. Rose said in his suit that Azoff failed to promote his 2008
        album, <i>Chinese Democracy</i>, and deliberately mishandled concert dates, "forcing Rose into a position where
        he would have no choice but to reunite with the original members of Guns N' Roses for a reunion tour." Rose
        claimed that Azoff "violated the consent decree by coercing and bullying artists to do what he wants" and that
        "Upon realizing that he couldn't bully Rose and accomplish his scheme, Azoff resigned and abandoned Guns N'
        Roses on the eve of a major tour, filing suit for commissions he didn't earn and had no right to receive. The
        lawsuit was settled "to the mutual satisfaction of the parties" in 2011. Several years later, Guns N' Roses'
        management, led by Rose's former personal assistant Beta Lebeis and her family, stated that previous tensions
        led to an ultimatum of "no more managers."</p>

    <p>Guns N' Roses headlined the Friday night at <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Festival'>Reading
        Festival</a> 2010 and closed <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_Festival'>Leeds Festival</a> two days
        later. Guns N' Roses was 58 minutes late coming on to the stage, and because of a curfew issued by Reading
        Council the band's set ended at midnight. The band was therefore not able to complete its set, but nevertheless
        attempted to play "Paradise City" without amplification while the audience sang along. Rose orchestrated fan
        frustration toward the organizers, telling fans that the group would not play at the Leeds Festival. However,
        two days later the band played the final night of the Leeds Festival, coming onto stage 30 minutes late, and
        cutting part of the encore, with Rose stating to the crowd, "We come here to play for you but the cops and the
        promoters wanna fuck us in the ass. We would like to play a few more songs for you but we'll just play one."
        During a concert on September 1, in Dublin, the band was over an hour late arriving on stage. Rose stopped the
        band in the middle of the second song, "Welcome to the Jungle" after multiple bottles were thrown on stage,
        warning the crowd "One more bottle and we go home. It's up to you. We would like to stay. We want to stay. We
        want to have some fun." After another bottle was thrown, the band left the stage during the fourth song of the
        set. The band returned to the stage an hour later to finish the show.</p>
    <p>Former bassist Duff McKagan joined the band on stage for the first time since leaving the band on October 14,
        2010 at The O2 Arena, in London, England. He performed four songs with the group: "You Could Be Mine", "Nice
        Boys", "Knockin' on Heaven's Door", and "Patience". The appearance was said to be a spur-of-the-moment decision,
        as he and Rose happened to be staying in the same hotel. Rose told the audience, "There was this guy at the end
        of my hallway playing all this loud music and shit. What the fuck? Oh &#8212; it's Duff!". McKagan later joined
        Guns N' Roses on part of its tour for two <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle'>Seattle</a> shows in
        December 2011, as well as having his band Loaded open for Guns N' Roses.</p>
    <p>Guns N' Roses performed at Rock in Rio 4 on October 2, 2011 during heavy rain, playing "Estranged" for the first
        time since 1993. Guitarist Bumblefoot stated that due to the conditions, it was the 'worst concert he's ever
        been a part of'. Two months later, during a performance in Nashville, TN "Civil War" also made a return after an
        eighteen-year absence. On November 10, 2011, Rose gave his first TV interview in years to Eddie Trunk, Don
        Jamieson and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Florentine'>Jim Florentine</a> of <i>That Metal Show</i>,
        discussing his whole career and the band's future.</p>
    <p>On December 7, 2011, it was announced that the classic Guns N' Roses lineup was to be inducted into the Rock and
        Roll Hall of Fame, along with several other acts, including the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers'>Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> and The Faces.
        Commenting on his Twitter, Rose stated "I'd like to thank the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame and our fans. This is
        your victory". Commenting on the induction during his <i>That Metal Show</i> interview he said "I don't know
        what it means in terms of me with the old band and the old lineup,"...&#160;"If we were to be invited, I don't
        know what they would ask of me. It's up in the air." Slash also commented, saying, "Thanks for all the R&amp;RHF
        mentions, It's quite an honor to be inducted. Cheers! Iii|;&#160;)" He went on to say, "I have no idea how
        that's supposed to go. If Axl, Duff, Izzy and myself start communicating, it could go one way. If we don't, God
        knows."</p>

    <p>In early 2012, the band announced shows in the United States and Europe, titled the Up Close and Personal Tour.
        The shows themselves varied considerably in comparison to the previous Chinese Democracy Tour. All of the North
        American shows took place in smaller-scale clubs, rather than a large arena or stadium. All pyrotechnics were
        removed from the shows. The European leg of the tour began approximately one month after the band's induction
        into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Guitarist DJ Ashba discussed a potential follow up to <i>Chinese
            Democracy</i> in a 2012 interview, stating "I've written and demoed up probably about 12 songs, I think. And
        some of them [Axl] has heard, some of them he hasn't yet. But I think when we get a little bit of time off,
        we're gonna hopefully all get together and piece together what we think is gonna be the next best thing."</p>
    <p>In an interview, Dizzy Reed supported the hypothesis of the classic lineup reunited in the Hall of Fame, saying,
        "I know that all the original band is going to be there. I don't know exactly what's going to go down. It's one
        of those things I'm sure will all come together and be really cool. Honestly, we haven't spoken about it. I
        don't know when or why or how to bring it up."</p>
    <p>On April 11, 2012, Rose released an open letter to "The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Guns N' Roses Fans and Whom
        It May Concern", saying he would not be attending the induction. Rose stated, "I respectfully decline my
        induction as a member of Guns N' Roses to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame" and called it a "complicated and
        awkward situation." After the ceremony, Rose released a statement on the band's <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook'>Facebook</a> page apologizing to the city of Cleveland (where
        the ceremony took place) and detailing reasons why he did not attend, stating "I still don't exactly know or
        understand what the Hall is or how or why it makes money, where the money goes, who chooses the voters and why
        anyone [on] this board decides who, out of all the artists in the world that have contributed to this genre,
        [is] officially "rock" enough to be in the Hall?"</p>

    <p>On April 14, 2012, former Guns N' Roses members Slash, Duff McKagan, Gilby Clarke, Steven Adler and Matt Sorum
        all reunited at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The group performed "Mr. Brownstone", "Sweet Child o' Mine", and
        "Paradise City" with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_Bridge'>Alter Bridge</a> and Slash's band vocalist
        <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Kennedy'>Myles Kennedy</a> in Rose's absence. Slash mentioned in an
        interview that "All things considered, I don't think any of us wanted to be a part of it initially, didn't think
        any of us were going to go. It was a thorn in everybody's&#8212;well, at least a thorn in my side&#8212;because
        I was busy doing other stuff. When it finally came down to the wire at the very, very, very last-minute&#8212;I'm
        talking about the 11 hours and 30 seconds mark&#8212;Axl had pulled out." In the same interview, Slash mentioned
        the prospects of a reunion, stating "It's not even something I like to dwell on. I don't even like to make to
        make comments because you end up with quotes that sometimes exacerbate the issue. I've got other things going
        on. I'm very, very proud&#8212;endlessly proud&#8212;of everything the band stood for and everything that's gone
        on with it." Slash then stated in a July 2012 interview that "[the classic lineup] will 'never reunite'". In a
        later interview, former drummer Steven Adler stated that Matt Sorum would not take part in a potential reunion
        unless Adler was involved. Duff McKagan said in 2015, "[A reunion] could happen, and it could not. And I think
        it would be wonderful, one day, if we reconciled, first and foremost. That alone would be cool."</p>
    <p>Richard Fortus, being interviewed by the French music website <i>Rock N' Live</i> in June 2012, revealed that the
        band would not play any more dates for the "Up Close and Personal Tour", as the band members hoped to spend more
        time in the studio, hoping to complete the next album by the end of the year. Fortus said, "I'm pretty much
        focused on GnR right now. We're getting ready to go back in the studio, so that's where my head's at right now,
        that's all I want to think about until the end of the year, pretty much."</p>
    <p>Izzy Stradlin once again joined the band for a surprise performance at a wedding in Saint-Tropez, France in July
        2012. Also in July 2012, the band toured <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel'>Israel</a> for the first
        time since 1992. <i>NME</i> reported that year that the band's tour security said they had been instructed by
        Guns N' Roses management that anyone wearing a Slash T-shirt not be allowed into the tour venue.</p>
    <p>On August 13, 2012, the band announced a residency at The Joint in Las Vegas entitled "Appetite for Democracy",
        celebrating the 25th anniversary of the band's debut album, <i>Appetite for Destruction</i>, and the fourth
        anniversary of the album <i>Chinese Democracy</i>. On November 21, 2012, the band's performance in Vegas was
        taped in 3D, and was screened across theaters in 2014 before being released as <i>Appetite for Democracy 3D</i>
        on July 1, 2014. In October 2012, Rose mentioned that the follow-up to <i>Chinese Democracy</i> would not take
        as long to be released, stating, "All the guys are writing, and we recorded a lot of songs over the years. We'll
        figure out what we feel best about. <i>Chinese</i> was done in piecemeal with one person here and one there at
        different times." In October 2012, Guns N' Roses performed an acoustic set at Neil Young's <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_School_Benefit'>Bridge School Benefit</a> show. The performance
        was widely panned by critics, and Rose claimed an onset of strep throat hampered his vocals.</p>

    <p>In August 2013, a new song titled "Going Down" was leaked online. The track features bassist Tommy Stinson on
        lead vocals, with Rose providing back up vocals. Bumblefoot confirmed the song to be legitimate on his Twitter.
        Spin described it as "a country-tinged, mid-tempo lighter-raiser with lyrics about how "you've got nothin' good
        to say / Keep your mouth shut."</p>
    <p>The band launched a South American tour in early 2014, including playing in <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil'>Brazil</a> and Portugal. For several shows, former bassist Duff
        McKagan rejoined the band to fill in for Stinson, who had previous commitments to touring with The Replacements.
        The group headlined the Revolver Golden Gods awards show, with McKagan on bass, on April 24, 2014. During the
        ceremony, Rose was awarded the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_James_Dio'>Ronnie James Dio</a>
        lifetime achievement award. After the show, Fortus reiterated the band was working on material and mentioned the
        possibility of releasing new music within the next year.</p>
    <p>From May 21 to June 7, 2014, the band returned to Las Vegas for its second residency at The Joint, titled <i>No
        Trickery! An Evening of Destruction</i>." In an interview in June 2014, Rose commented on upcoming plans:</p>
    <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <p>We recorded a lot of things before <i>Chinese</i> was out. We've worked more on some of those things and
            we've written a few new things. But basically, we have what I call kind of the second half of <i>Chinese</i>.
            That's already recorded. And then we have a remix album made of the songs from <i>Chinese</i>. That's been
            done for a while, too. But after Vegas, we're going to start looking very seriously at what we're doing in
            that regard.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Reed mentioned that the next album was 'close to being done' in July 2014, adding it was "just a matter of
        picking out which songs will be on it" and that the band had a "shitload of songs, enough to make up another
        record or two". Later that month, Fortus discussed the band working on new material and taking a break from
        touring. A year later, Fortus discussed a potential 2016 tour and mentioned that the next album "should be out"
        by then. Reed responded by saying "When will it come out? We just don't know yet. Only Axl knows, and he's very
        secretive. Be patient."</p>

    <h3>Regrouping, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_in_This_Lifetime..._Tour'>
        Not in This Lifetime... Tour</a> and future (2015&#8211;present)</h3>
    <p>On July 27, 2015, guitarist DJ Ashba left the band, citing his commitments to his family and other band, <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixx:A.M.'>Sixx:A.M.</a> Ashba released a statement saying "I have reached a
        point in my life where I feel it's time to dedicate myself to my band Sixx:A.M., my adoring wife and family, and
        to the many new adventures that the future holds for me." Several days later, music journalist <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Graff'>Gary Graff</a> reported that a 'confirmed source within the
        band' had told him that Ron Thal was no longer in Guns N' Roses and had left after the 2014 tour. No official
        announcement from Thal or the band has been made regarding his status. Tommy Stinson then left the band, citing
        personal reasons keeping him unable to tour. Frank Ferrer clarified the status of the band in mid-2015, saying
        "Guns still exist&#160;... [They have] a lot of moving parts, and there's a lot of things in the works&#160;...
        everything is moving forward."</p>
    <p>On December 29, 2015, several days after a Guns N' Roses related teaser was released to movie theaters, <i>Billboard</i>
        reported that Slash was set to rejoin the band and a "reunited" lineup will headline Coachella 2016. Rose was
        set to appear on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> the following week to talk about the future of the band, but his
        appearance was cancelled due to "unforeseen circumstances". Guns N' Roses was officially announced as the
        headliner of Coachella on January 4, 2016, with KROQ reporting Slash and Duff McKagan are rejoining the band.
        The Coachella festival confirmed via press release that McKagan and Slash were rejoining. The band's first
        scheduled concerts with Slash and McKagan took place at the newly opened T-Mobile Arena on April 8 and 9, 2016.
        On March 25, 2016, the band announced 21 cities as part of a North American tour, dubbed the Not in This
        Lifetime... Tour.</p>

    <p>A previously unannounced warmup gig at the Troubadour in Los Angeles took place on April 1, 2016. Melissa Reese,
        who has previously worked with former drummer Bryan Mantia on several projects, replaced Chris Pitman for the
        tour. During the show at the Troubadour, Rose fell and broke his foot. Rose was given Dave Grohl's customized
        throne that Grohl used to perform when he broke his leg at a concert. At the performance at the first weekend of
        Coachella, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC'>AC/DC</a> guitarist <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Young'>Angus Young</a> joined the band on stage (Rose was set to
        join AC/DC as a touring vocalist). Young's guest appearance was only the third time he had jammed with another
        band since 1977.</p>
    <p>Rose discussed the regrouping in a June 2016 interview, stating "It was always looked at as a possibility, but it
        never seemed right or felt right". During the interview, Rose also reiterated his intention to release new Guns
        N' Roses music in the future. Slash later commented on the tour, telling Aerosmith's <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Kramer'>Joey Kramer</a> in an interview with <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/WZLX'>WZLX</a> that "We all were pretty positive (the reunion) would
        never happen, so it&#8217;s still sort of blowing our minds.... But everybody&#8217;s really getting along great
        and I think everybody&#8217;s come a long way, and it&#8217;s all cool."</p>
    <p>During the band's July 6th show in Cincinnati, former drummer Steven Adler joined the band on drums for "Out to
        Get Me" and "My Michelle". It was the first time since 1990 that Adler performed with the group. Adler would
        later join the band at shows in Nashville and Los Angeles.</p>
    <h2>Legacy, style, influence and criticism</h2>
    <p>Guns N' Roses signed with a major label within eight months of the group's inception, and topped national sales
        charts weeks after garnering late hours airplay on MTV. <i>Appetite for Destruction</i> is the highest-selling
        debut album of all time in the United States. Peers of the band in the music industry often spoke highly of the
        band. Joe Perry stated that the band was the first group to remind him of Led Zeppelin. <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzy_Osbourne'>Ozzy Osbourne</a> stated that Guns N' Roses could have
        been "the next Rolling Stones" if the classic lineup stayed together. Country musician <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Earle'>Steve Earle</a> stated in 1989 that "Guns n' Roses are what
        every L.A. band pretends to be".</p>

    <p>The music of Guns N' Roses is a fusion of punk rock, blues rock, heavy metal, hard rock, and hair metal. The <i>Illusions</i>
        albums saw the band branching out into art rock, while <i>"The Spaghetti Incident?"</i> saw the group blend hard
        rock with punk rock. Since the group's 1999 revival, the band has retained hard rock features while also
        experimenting with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_rock'>Industrial rock</a> and electronic rock.
        In the 1990s, the band integrated keyed instruments (played by either Rose or Reed, and accompanied on tour by
        Teddy Andreadis) into the band, and for roughly half of the <i>Use Your Illusion</i> tour, added a horn section
        to the stage.</p>
    <p>A heavy influence on both the image and sound of Guns N' Roses was the Finnish band Hanoi Rocks (singer Michael
        Monroe and Rose have collaborated on various occasions). Rose has stated that the band was massively inspired by
        groups like Queen, AC/DC, The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, and Rose Tattoo, and that the sound of <i>Appetite for
            Destruction</i> was influenced by AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Cheap Trick, Aerosmith, Van Halen, the New York
        Dolls, and Hanoi Rocks. The band was also influenced by the likes of T. Rex and the Sex Pistols. Rose's
        orchestral-style songwriting on the Illusion albums were influenced by Queen, Electric Light Orchestra, and
        Elton John, particularly the album <i>Queen II</i>. Rose cited the influence of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen
        Spirit" in recording the title track of <i>Chinese Democracy</i>. Critics noted influences of Queen, Wings and
        <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lloyd_Webber'>Andrew Lloyd Webber</a> on some songs on <i>Chinese
            Democracy</i>.</p>
    <p>Guns N' Roses has influenced many modern rock bands such as Fall Out Boy, Avenged Sevenfold, Mother Love Bone,
        Buckcherry, Hinder, Manic Street Preachers, Nickelback, Bullet for My Valentine, and Black Label Society.</p>

    <p>In 2002, <i>Q</i> magazine named Guns N' Roses in its list of the "50 Bands to See Before You Die". The
        television network <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/VH1'>VH1</a> ranked Guns N' Roses ninth in its "100
        Greatest Artists of Hard Rock" special, and also 32nd on its "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". <i>Appetite for
            Destruction</i> was ranked 62nd greatest album of all time in <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine's special issue
        "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". In 2004, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked Guns N' Roses No.&#160;92 on its
        thlist of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". "Welcome to the Jungle" has also been voted "Best Hard Rock
        Song" out of 100 candidates by VH1.</p>
    <p>Guns N' Roses was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 14, 2012. The group is one of the world's
        best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 100 million records worldwide, including shipments of 45
        million in the United States. The U.S. release of the PlayStation game <i>Mega Man X5</i> had the names of the
        game's bosses changed in honor of the band.</p>
    <p>Guns N' Roses has also received significant criticism throughout the years. The band received criticism for drug
        and alcohol use in the 80's &amp; early 90's. The long periods of time between albums are another source of
        criticism. Songs such as "One in a Million" and the cover of Charles Manson's "Look at Your Game, Girl" were
        considerably controversial upon release. In addition, some lyrics have been regarded as sexist.</p>
    <p>The band has also been criticized for tardiness and starting shows later than advertised. The band's late
        appearances and "war" with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_and_Leeds_Festivals'>Reading and Leeds
            Festivals</a> have been criticized by artists and peers of the group in the industry.</p>
    <p>In October 2009, Ulrich Schnauss's record labels Independiente and Domino sued Guns N' Roses, alleging that the
        band had committed copyright infringement by using portions of Schnauss' compositions in the track "Riad N' the
        Bedouins" on the album <i>Chinese Democracy</i>. The band claimed the samples "were provided by a member of the
        album's production team who has assured us that these few seconds of sound were obtained legitimately." <i>Chinese
            Democracy</i> was banned in the People's Republic of China, due to perceived criticism in its title track of
        the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_People' s_Republic_of_China'>Government of the People's
        Republic of China</a> and reference to the Falun Gong. The Chinese government said through the media that it
        "turns its spear point on China".</p>
