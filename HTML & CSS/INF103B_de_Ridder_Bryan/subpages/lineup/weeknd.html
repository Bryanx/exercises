    <p><b>Ab&#233;l Makkonen Tesfaye</b> (born 16 February 1990), known professionally as <b>The Weeknd</b> (pronounced
        "the weekend"), is a Canadian singer, songwriter and record producer. In late 2010, Tesfaye anonymously uploaded
        several songs to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube'>YouTube</a> under the name "The Weeknd". He
        released three nine-track mixtapes throughout 2011: <i>House of Balloons</i>, <i>Thursday</i>, and <i>Echoes of
            Silence</i>, which were critically acclaimed. The following year, he released a compilation album
        <i>Trilogy</i>, thirty tracks consisting of remastered versions of the mixtape material and three additional
        songs. It was released under <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_Records'>Republic Records</a> and his
        own label XO.</p>
    <p>In 2013, he released his debut studio album <i>Kiss Land</i>, which was supported by the singles "Kiss Land" and
        "Live For". His second album, <i>Beauty Behind the Madness</i>, which became his first number one album on the
        <i>Billboard</i> 200, included the top-five single "Earned It" and produced the number-one singles "The Hills"
        and "Can't Feel My Face". The songs have simultaneously held the top three spots on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot R&amp;B
        Songs chart, making him the first artist in history to achieve this. The Weeknd has won two Grammy Awards and
        has been nominated for an Academy Award. In September 2016, the release of the third album, <i>Starboy</i> was
        announced, along with the release of the tracks "Starboy" and "False Alarm".</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>Ab&#233;l Makkonen Tesfaye was born on 16 February 1990, in Scarborough, Ontario, a district of Toronto. He is
        the only child of Makkonen and Samra Tesfaye, who were Ethiopian migrants to <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada'>Canada</a> in the 1980s. He was raised in Scarborough, a
        diversely multicultural neighborhood within the city. During The Weeknd's youth, his mother would work several
        jobs to supplement the family, often as a nurse and caterer, while also attending night school. His father later
        abandoned the family, prompting The Weeknd's maternal grandmother to care for him while he was young. This
        allowed for him to become fluent in Amharic, with the Semitic language acting as his first language. She would
        also take him to services at an <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Orthodox'>Ethiopian Orthodox</a>
        church.</p>
    <p>The Weeknd started smoking marijuana at age 11, and later moved on to harder drugs. He has credited devising his
        stage name following dropping out of high school in 2007, adopting the name "The Weeknd" after he and a friend
        "left [school] one weekend and never came home". The spelling was modified to avoid trademark issues with the
        Canadian band The Weekend.</p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <h3>2010&#8211;11: Career beginnings and mixtapes
    </h3>

    <p>Tesfaye met producer Jeremy Rose, who had an idea for a dark R&amp;B musical project called "The Weeknd". After
        trying to pitch the idea to musician Curtis Santiago, Rose played one of his instrumentals for Tesfaye, who
        freestyled over it, and they began working on an album. He produced three songs &#8211; "What You Need", "Loft
        Music", and "The Morning" &#8211; and others that Tesfaye rapped on, which Rose ultimately scrapped. Rose let
        Tesfaye keep the tracks he had produced under the condition that he would ultimately be credited for them.
        However, in December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded "What You Need", "Loft Music", and "The Morning" to YouTube under
        the name "The Weeknd", though his identity was initially unknown. The songs drew attention online through word
        of mouth, including a blog featuring the songs posted by rapper Drake, who also helped generate interest in The
        Weeknd. They subsequently received coverage from outlets such as <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_Media'>Pitchfork Media</a> and <i>The New York Times</i>.</p>
    <p>On 21 March 2011, Tesfaye released the nine-track mixtape <i>House of Balloons</i> for free through his website.
        It featured production by <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Illangelo'>Illangelo</a> and Doc McKinney, although
        it did not credit Rose for his tracks. <i>House of Balloons</i> was met with critical acclaim, and was named as
        one of ten shortlisted nominees for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.</p>
    <p>In July, The Weeknd embarked on a tour and delivered his first performance at the <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_Club'>Mod Club</a> in Toronto. The hour-and-a-half long performance
        created buzz about him. His next performance took place at Toronto&#8217;s Molson Canadian Amphitheatre. He
        collaborated extensively with rapper Drake lending his vocals to several standout tracks on Drake's
        multi-platinum <i>Take Care</i> album and appeared as one of the special guests to Drake's second Annual <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/OVO_Fest'>OVO Fest</a> on 31 July 2011. During the summer, the press
        noted that The Weeknd refused to participate in interviews and chose to only communicate via Twitter. His second
        mixtape <i>Thursday</i> was released on 18 August 2011, as a free digital download from The Weeknd's website,
        and was well received by critics. The Weeknd's third mixtape, titled <i>Echoes of Silence</i>, was released on
        21 December 2011. Upon this release, the three 2011 mixtapes were collectively known as the <i>Balloons
            Trilogy</i>, each receiving critical acclaim and growing Tesfaye's fanbase.</p>
    <h3>2012&#8211;14: <i>Trilogy</i> and <i>Kiss Land</i></h3>

    <p>In April 2012, The Weeknd began his U.S. tour by performing at the Coachella Festival. He and his band visited
        various major cities and culminated in New York, where two sold-out shows were positively reviewed by <i>Rolling
            Stone</i>. Tesfaye and his tour band continued in major European festivals, including the Primavera Sound
        Festivals in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain'>Spain</a> and Portugal, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Festival'>Wireless Festival</a> in London, plus concerts in
        Paris and Brussels. At his debut UK show in London, he covered Michael Jackson's "Dirty Diana" in front of an
        audience which included <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry'>Katy Perry</a> and Florence Welch. In
        June, it was reported that the <i>Balloons Trilogy</i> had been downloaded 8 million times and that it would be
        formally released later in the year.</p>

    <p>In September 2012, The Weeknd signed with Republic Records in a joint venture with his own imprint XO. The
        compilation album <i>Trilogy</i> was released in November, consisting of remastered versions of the mixtapes and
        three additional songs. It also officially credited Rose as a producer and writer on three songs from <i>House
            of Balloons</i>. <i>Trilogy</i> charted at No. 5 on the Canadian Albums Chart, and No. 4 on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i>
        200 with first-week sales of 86,000 copies. Shortly after in December, the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC'>BBC</a> announced that The Weeknd had been nominated for the Sound
        of 2013 poll. In May 2013, <i>Trilogy</i> was certified platinum by the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America'>Recording Industry
            Association of America</a> and double-platinum by Music Canada.</p>
    <p>On 16 May 2013, The Weeknd premiered the title track to his debut studio album <i>Kiss Land</i>, which he said
        will be released on 10 September. It was also promoted by the singles "Belong to the World", "Live For"
        featuring Drake and The Weeknd's The Fall tour beginning in September. <i>Kiss Land</i> received generally
        positive reviews from music critics. <i>Kiss Land</i> debuted at number two on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> 200,
        selling 96,000 copies, just two thousand copies short of Keith Urban's <i>Fuse</i>, which took the number one
        spot that week.</p>
    <p>The Weeknd also appeared on the soundtrack to <i>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</i>, contributing "Devil May
        Cry" and featuring on "Elastic Heart" by Sia, the second single from the soundtrack. In late 2013, The Weeknd
        joined <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake'>Justin Timberlake</a> on his <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_20/20_Experience_World_Tour'>The 20/20 Experience World Tour</a> for
        six shows. In February 2014, he remixed the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc&#233;'>Beyonc&#233;</a>
        single "Drunk in Love". The remix was more of a cover, as The Weeknd tweaked the beat to fit better with his
        version of the song, that is told through the male perspective.</p>
    <p>On 26 June 2014, The Weeknd announced that he will be headlining the <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Fall'>King of the Fall</a> tour, essentially a mini-tour across
        America in September and October 2014. ScHoolboy Q and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhen&#233;_Aiko'>Jhen&#233;
            Aiko</a> were confirmed as support acts. The announcement came the day after The Weeknd released his new
        song, "Often", on SoundCloud, leading to speculation that the tour will unveil more new material from him. On 20
        July 2014, The Weeknd released another track titled "King of the Fall" to promote his upcoming tour, which
        started in September. On 30 September 2014, the song "Love Me Harder" was released which is a duet between The
        Weeknd and Ariana Grande, the song went on to peak at number seven on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart. On 23
        December 2014, he released "Earned It", the song was released as a single from the 2015 film <i>Fifty Shades of
            Grey</i>, which has peaked at number 3 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. The Weeknd performed a rendition of
        the song alongside <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Keys'>Alicia Keys</a> at the 2015 BET Awards.</p>
    <h3>2015: <i>Beauty Behind the Madness</i></h3>

    <p>On 27 May 2015, The Weeknd released a music video for a new song "The Hills". The song was later released as a
        digital download as the first single from The Weeknd's second studio album dubbed, <i>Chapter III</i>. "The
        Hills" debuted at number 20 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, becoming the week's "Hot Shot" debut; the single
        later went on to top the chart. In addition to the single's official release, a further three songs were leaked
        online in the corresponding days. On 8 June, "Can't Feel My Face", one of the leaked tracks, was officially
        released as a second single following a performance of the song by The Weeknd at Apple's Worldwide Developers
        Conference on the same day. The song debuted at number 24 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and reached
        number-one on the Hot 100, making it his third top 10 hit and his first number-one hit in the United States. On
        4 July, The Weeknd headlined <i>FVDED in the Park</i> in Surrey, BC, Canada.</p>
    <p>In <i>Billboard's</i> Hot R&amp;B Songs chart for the week of 25 July 2015, The Weeknd held down all of the top
        three spots, with "Can't Feel My Face" at number one, "The Hills" at number 2 and "Earned It" at number 3. This
        made him the first artist in the history of that chart to earn this distinction.</p>
    <p>Following the announcement of the launch of Apple's new streaming service, Apple Music, it was unveiled that The
        Weeknd has joined as one of the musical faces alongside frequent collaborator Drake. During the 2015 <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV'>MTV</a> Video Music Awards, Apple debuted a two-part promotional
        commercial featuring The Weeknd and a guest appearance from John Travolta.</p>
    <p>On 28 August 2015, The Weeknd's second studio album, <i>Beauty Behind the Madness</i>, was released and topped
        the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with first week sales of 412,000 equivalent units (326,000 pure album sales). It spent
        three weeks at the top of the chart. The album reached the top 10 in over ten countries and topped the charts in
        Canada, Australia, Norway and the United Kingdom. The Weeknd promoted the album by headlining summer music
        festivals, including <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollapalooza'>Lollapalooza</a> in Chicago, the Hard
        Summer Music Festival in Pomona, the Summer Set Music and Camping Festival in Somerset, Philadelphia's Made in
        America Festival, Austin City Limits in Austin, and Seattle's <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumbershoot'>Bumbershoot</a>
        Festival. 'The Madness Fall Tour 2015', The Weeknd's North American tour to promote his new album was announced
        on 20 August 2015, and will begin in November. The tour will feature opening acts Travis Scott, Banks and
        Halsey. On 24 August 2015, The Weeknd released a video for "Tell Your Friends", a song produced by <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West'>Kanye West</a> from the album.</p>
    <p>On the week of 8 September 2015, The Weeknd became the first male artist in nearly seven years with two songs on
        the Hot 100's top three in the same week, with "Can't Feel My Face" at number 2 and "The Hills" at number 3,
        both as a lead act. The Weeknd has been featured in several collaborations this year, including Belly's "Might
        Not", Meek Mill's "Pullin Up" and Travis Scott's "Pray 4 Love". The Weeknd also featured on Disclosure's
        sophomore album, <i>Caracal</i>, a collaboration entitled "Nocturnal". On 10 October 2015, The Weeknd joined
        actress <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Schumer'>Amy Schumer</a> on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> as a
        musical guest. This was his first performance on the show as a solo artist after appearing during Ariana Grande&#8217;s
        set for their "Love Me Harder" collaboration.</p>
    <p>As of 1 December 2015, <i>Beauty Behind the Madness</i> became the most-streamed album throughout 2015 with over
        60 million listeners. It was also placed at number five on <i>Rolling Stone's</i> 50 Best Albums of 2015. On 25
        December 2015, The Weeknd released two new songs, "Low Life" and a remixed version of Jeremih's "Pass Dat".</p>
    <h3>2016: <i>Starboy</i></h3>
    <p>In 2016, The Weeknd was featured on the song "FML" from Kanye West's 2016 album, <i>The Life of Pablo</i> and
        appeared on Beyonc&#233;'s song "6 Inch" from her album <i>Lemonade</i>.</p>
    <p>On 24 August 2016, The Weeknd is reported working together with French electronic music duo Daft Punk, and is
        confirmed by Republic Records executive vice president Wendy Goldstei, while he was interviewed by
        <i>Billboard</i>.</p>
    <p>On 26 August 2016, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashmere_Cat'>Cashmere Cat</a> released a single to his new
        album, "Wild Love", and The Weeknd is featured on this track providing vocals.</p>
    <p>On 21 September 2016, The Weeknd announced the name of his third studio album, <i>Starboy</i>. The 18 track album
        will be released through XO and Republic. The following day he released the title track, which features Daft
        Punk. <i>Starboy</i> is set to release on November 25.</p>
    <p>On 1 October 2016, The Weeknd was a musical guest on Saturday Night Live. The Weeknd performed "Starboy" and
        "False Alarm".</p>
    <h2>Artistry and image</h2>
    <p>The Weeknd cites Michael Jackson, Prince and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Kelly'>R. Kelly</a> as his
        main inspirations. He often says it was Jackson's music that made him want to be a singer, and the lyrics to
        "Dirty Diana". He also said his high-flying vocal style was influenced by habesha singers like Aster Aweke. He
        grew up listening to a variety of music genres, including soul, quiet storm, hip hop, funk, indie rock, and
        post-punk. Other influences include Portishead, Massive Attack, Cam'ron, Aaliyah, D'Angelo, The-Dream, Swizz
        Beatz, The Smiths, Bad Brains, Talking Heads, and DeBarge.</p>
    <p>The Weeknd's songs are "built around a fogged, crepuscular production", and feature slow tempos, rumbling bass,
        and forlorn echoes. The Weeknd sings in a falsetto register, and exhibits a pleading, anxious tone. <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Considine'>J. D. Considine</a> finds his singing's "tremulous
        quality" similar to Michael Jackson, but writes that he eschews Jackson's "strong basis in the blues" for a more
        Arabic-influenced melisma. His music incorporates samples that are unconventional in R&amp;B production,
        including punk and alternative rock. Marc Hogan of <i>Spin</i> says that The Weeknd's samples tend "to draw from
        rock critic-approved sources, though generally ones that already share elements of his sexual menace", with
        samples of artists such as Beach House, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Aaliyah. The Weeknd worked mostly with
        producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, whom Pitchfork Media's Ian Cohen credits with developing "a
        state-of-the-art R&amp;B template" with The Weeknd. In concert, The Weeknd reappropriates his digitized
        productions with a suite-like arena rock aesthetic.</p>
    <p>His emotional, plaintive lyrics often express feelings of hurt and deal with subject matter such as sex, drugs,
        and partying. Hermione Hoby of <i>The Guardian</i> characterizes The Weeknd's songs as "narcotised-slow jams"
        and delineates their message as "partying is an existential experience, sex is fraught with alienation, and
        everything registers as unreal and unsettling". <i>The Guardian</i>'s Paul MacInnes interprets The
        Weeknd's trilogy of mixtapes as "a rough trajectory of party, after-party and hangover". Anupa Mistry of the <i>Toronto
            Standard</i> observes throughout his mixtapes a "cast of supine, stoned zombie-women ... whose legs
        willingly part after being plied with substances and who morph into threats only when [he is] coming down and
        feeling vulnerable". The Weeknd viewed that, by singing vulgar, ignorant lyrics in an elegant, sexy way, he is
        paying homage to R. Kelly and to some degree Prince.</p>
    <p>Some journalists have associated The Weeknd with a broadening of R&amp;B's musical palette to incorporate indie
        and electronic styles; his work has been categorized with the alternative R&amp;B tag (sometimes humorously
        referred to as PBR&amp;B). Mistry writes that he "will be obsequiously praised as the future of R&amp;B music
        &#8211; because [he] is a black singer, not because he&#8217;s making quantifiable, canonical R&amp;B".
        AllMusic's Andy Kellman categorizes him as an "alternative R&amp;B act". Prior to his major label deal, The
        Weeknd withheld his identity and maintained an enigmatic, shadowy persona while releasing his mixtapes
        online.</p>
    <h2>Recognition</h2>

    <p>The Weeknd has received praise from many musical artists. Veteran artist Babyface who spoke positively about The
        Weeknd stated, "I do love The Weeknd, and I love how, whoever he&#8217;s working with, they&#8217;re using
        pieces of R&amp;B with other things that feel really great. [...] It&#8217;s promising in the sense that I think
        there are other unknowns that will come forward and get back to being musicians. I think more than anything,
        what I miss is the musicians being part of the process." Drake, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Jonas'>Nick
            Jonas</a> and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tove_Lo'>Tove Lo</a> have cited him as a musical influence.
    </p>
    <h2>Personal life</h2>
    <p>The Weeknd began dating <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Hadid'>Bella Hadid</a> at the beginning of 2015;
        the couple were first seen together in April at Coachella. Hadid has starred in his music video "In the Night"
        in December 2015. They also made their red carpet appearance as a couple at the 2016 Grammys in February.</p>
    <p>His hairstyle&#8212;which is partly inspired by Jean-Michel Basquiat&#8212;is by far his most recognizable trait.
        "There's not much to maintaining it," he says &#8212; just a hard shampoo every once in a while. He began
        growing it out around 2011: "I want to be remembered as iconic and different," he says. "So I was like, 'Fuck it
        &#8212; I'm gonna let my hair just be what it wants.' I'll probably cut it if it starts interfering with my
        sight. I can kind of see it right now. But if I cut it, I'd look like everyone else. And that's just so boring
        to me."</p>
    <p>On social media outlets such as Twitter, he suffixed his name with "xo". According to Hoby, it is meant as an
        emoticon for "a kiss and a hug", while VH1's Zara Golden said that it is instead a reference to his recreational
        use of ecstasy and oxycodone.</p>
