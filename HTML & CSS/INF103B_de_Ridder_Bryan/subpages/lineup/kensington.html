    <p><b>Kensington</b> are a Dutch rock band from Utrecht, Netherlands. Formed in 2005, the band has since released
        two EPs and three studio albums: <i>Borders</i> (2010), <i>Vultures</i> (2012) and <i>Rivals</i> (2014). The
        band consists of vocalist/guitarist Eloi Youssef, guitarist/vocalist Casper Starreveld, bassist Jan Haker and
        drummer Niles Vandenberg.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Early years (2005&#8211;08)</h3>
    <p>Kensington was formed in 2005 by singer/guitarist Casper Starreveld, bass player Jan Haker and drummer Lucas
        Lenselink. Singer/guitarist Eloi Youssef joined the band in 2006. Kensington's first official releases appear in
        2007 on Stuck in a Day Records: two-song promo single <i>An Introduction To...</i> and the five-song <i>Kensington
            EP</i>. This self-produced EP was recorded in the Second Moon Studio of Dutch folk singer Hessel van der
        Kooij, on the island of <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Terschelling'>Terschelling</a> and was mixed and
        mastered by Martijn Groeneveld in the Mailmen Studios in Utrecht. The <i>Kensington EP</i> received good
        reviews, from Dutch music platform MusicFromNL for example, which showers it with praise. "The band effortlessly
        combines different styles and moods into a comprehensive sound. (...) The quartet from <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht'>Utrecht</a> show musical sophistication on this debut. These
        five songs exhibit Kensington's prowess, originality and musicality. It is a well-produced, diverse and catchy
        record." The band played several shows in 2007 with Dutch touring showcase festival the Popronde, and as support
        for bands such as American indie rock band Movies With Heroes. They also appeared in TV shows on Dutch music
        channel TMF and in online and printed music magazines such as alternative pop platform 3VOOR12.</p>
    <p>At the end of 2007, drummer Lucas Lenselink decided to leave the band. Lenselink felt that his own ambitions do
        not match those of his band mates anymore. He explained that a career in music is not what he envisions for
        himself and that he wanted to focus on finishing his studies at university. After auditioning a couple of new
        drummers, Niles Vandenberg, former drummer of Griffin, joined Kensington in February 2008. Niles does share the
        ambitions of the rest of the band and is seen as "a great addition".</p>
    <p>Together with Niles, the band start working on their second EP. The EP, titled <i>Youth</i>, was released on 12
        December 2008 on Dutch indie label Snowstar Records. <i>Youth</i> received positive reviews from MusicFromNL,
        amongst others, which praises the inventiveness of the song structures and the professional-sounding production.
        The <i>Youth EP</i> generates attention from several record labels and the band eventually signs with
        Bladehammer/EMI. A label that shares the band's high ambitions.</p>
    <p>Dutch radio station 3FM included Kensington in its Serious Talent program. A program that aims to support local
        talent by providing air play on 3FM and by hosting shows around the country. In addition to this, Kensington
        were invited to be the support act for Razorlight, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Chemical_Romance'>My
            Chemical Romance</a> and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wombats'>The Wombats</a> for their shows in
        the Netherlands.</p>
    <h3><i>Borders</i> (2009&#8211;11)</h3>
    <p>In the summer of 2009, Kensington traveled to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds'>Leeds</a> to start work
        on their first album with producer James Kenosha, in the studio of Kaiser Chiefs's keyboardist Nick Baines. The
        album, titled <i>Borders</i>, comes out on July 17, 2010. The album was mastered by John Davis, who has worked
        with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Monkeys'>Arctic Monkeys</a> as well. Their first single "Youth"
        received regular airplay on 3FM, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV'>MTV</a> and TMF, and entered the Dutch
        <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Top_100'>Single Top 100</a> chart at number 78. The release of <i>Borders</i>
        also saw Eloi Youssef becoming the main lead vocalist of the band, where he had shared lead vocalist duties with
        Casper Starreveld on the band's earlier releases. The latter chose to focus on playing guitar and singing backup
        vocals. The band spent the rest of 2010 touring the Netherlands] with pop punk band MakeBelieve and several
        support acts. The second single to come off <i>Borders</i>, "When It All Falls Down", was released in November
        that year.</p>
    <p>In January 2011 Kensington played a show on the showcase festival Eurosonic Noorderslag, where the band was
        noticed by promoters from Dutch prime time TV show <i>De Wereld Draait Door</i>. On January 19 the band appear
        on the show to play their single "Youth". In February the band set out on its first tour as main headliner, the
        No Borders Tour. The tour was a success, with sold-out shows in Paradiso Amsterdam, Tivoli Utrecht and Rotown
        Rotterdam.</p>
    <p>Another eight shows were added when single "Let Go" came out in March 2011. "Let Go" was a new song which wasn't
        included on the initial release of <i>Borders</i>, but added to an April 2011 re-release of the album in <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Digipak'>Digipak</a> format. "Let Go" was chosen as 3FM's Megahit for
        the second week of April, which meant that the radio station gave the track extra airplay. For the "Let Go"
        tour, the band played in venues such as <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/013'>013</a> Tilburg and in the main
        hall of Paradiso Amsterdam as support for English pop group Scouting For Girls. Reviews for the shows were good,
        and Kensington established itself as a solid live band.</p>
    <p>In the summer of 2011 a great majority of <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kink_FM'>Kink FM</a> listeners vote
        for Kensington to become 'National Festival Ambassador of 2011'. This title includes a slot on Serbia's EXIT
        Festival, one of the larger European summer festivals. The band get invited to play on <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Rockin'>Java Rockin'land</a> in <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia'>Indonesia</a> as well. During their stay in Indonesia the
        band played two shows on the festival and a show at the Erasmushuis, the Dutch cultural centre in Jakarta.</p>
    <p>On 11 October 2011, <i>Borders</i> was released in the U.S. and Canada through Zip Records, an indie record label
        from San Francisco. The record also became available worldwide on iTunes. To celebrate the release of
        <i>Borders</i> in North America, the band released a video for "Let Go". Footage for the video was shot by young
        British director and editor Daniel Burnett during the band's stay in Indonesia and at several shows of the <i>Let
            Go</i> tour.</p>
    <p>On 25 October 2011, the band released "We Are the Young", the first single off the upcoming second studio album.
        The song was recorded in producer Niels Zuiderhoek's YouGuysMusic studios in <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin'>Berlin</a> and mixed by <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenzo_Townshend'>Cenzo Townshend</a> in London. Kensington spent the
        rest of 2011 working on their second album with Zuiderhoek in several recording sessions. In early November,
        they were invited to New York City, where they did some promotional work for Zip Records and played a show in
        the Cutting Room, a music venue in Manhattan. The band also did some radio interviews for college radio stations
        "The Atlantic Tunnel" and "East Village Radio", and appeared in Cognac Wellerlane's TV show <i>The Long Island
            Exchange</i>. In December, Kensington were back in the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands'>Netherlands</a>
        for a couple of shows where they premiere songs from their new album.</p>
    <h3>< id="Vultures_.282012.E2.80.9313.29"><i>Vultures</i> (2012&#8211;13)</h3>
    <p>Kensington used the first months of 2012 to perfect their second album, <i>Vultures</i>. The band had planned a
        tour in February and March but postponed it to April, so as to be able to work on the songs some more, and to
        give the fans the chance to listen to the album before the start of the tour. Eventually, it proved to be
        impossible to release the album before the start of the tour, but the band organises some dressing room
        listening sessions for a select group of fans, who get the chance to hear some of the album tracks before
        everyone else. The band takes advantage of the all but sold out shows in <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Effenaar'>Effenaar</a> Eindhoven, Hedon Zwolle, Tivoli Utrecht and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Melkweg'>Melkweg</a> Amsterdam to test-run the new material.</p>
    <p>April 6, 2012 saw the release of the second single from <i>Vultures</i>, "Send Me Away", on Universal Music. The
        songs got picked up by radio station 3FM straightaway, which put it on regular rotation.</p>
    <p>The band received two nominations at the 2012 3FM Awards in the categories "Serious Talent Award", which is
        awarded by a jury, and "Best Artist Rock", which is based on fan votes.</p>
    <p><i>Vultures</i> was released on May 11, 2012. The album was co-produced by Kensington and Niels Zuiderhoek, mixed
        by Cenzo Townshend, famous for his work with bands such as Editors, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Patrol'>Snow Patrol</a> and U2. <i>Vultures</i> is mastered in New
        York by Steve Fallone at Sterling Sound. Dutch music magazine <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/OOR'>OOR</a>
        call <i>Vultures</i> "the best Dutch album of 2012" and other media praise the international sound of the album.
    </p>
    <p>On July 10, 2012 the band released a third single, "No Way Out", which starred in its video, Hollywood actor
        Michael Koltes and Brazilian supermodel Ana Ara&#250;jo. The video was filmed in London in June and produced by
        Juriaan and Boris Booij, Dutch film-makers stationed in London.</p>
    <p>Kensington played several music festivals during the summer of 2012, such as the Indian Summer Festival. The band
        spent the remainder of the year touring the country in what is their biggest tour to date. The <i>Vultures</i>
        club tour has 18 dates, almost half of which sell out well in advance, including hometown venue Tivoli Utrecht.
    </p>
    <p>On 20 November, the band announced that <i>Vultures</i> would be released in Germany, Belgium, Austria,
        Switzerland and South Korea. The international version was released on 11 January 2013 through Universal Music.
        It included a previously unreleased song titled "Home Again", which featured in the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Wolfskin'>Jack Wolfskin</a> winter campaign commercial. The song
        became popular, and eventually was also released as a single. During the last show of the <i>Vultures</i> Tour
        in Tivoli Utrecht, the band filmed a video for "Home Again". It was directed and edited by Boris Booij.</p>
    <p>Kensington kick-started the year 2013 with eleven shows at the <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosonic_Noorderslag'>Eurosonic Noorderslag</a> Festival and a short 5-stop
        sold-out tour in the Netherlands in March and April. The band also played shows with <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Door_Cinema_Club'>Two Door Cinema Club</a> and Dutch rockband Kane.
        The band played several big festivals this summer amongst which are <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkpop'>Pinkpop</a>
