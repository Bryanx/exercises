    <p><b>Justin Drew Bieber</b> (born March 1, 1994) is a
        Canadian singer and songwriter. After a talent manager discovered him through his <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube'>YouTube</a> videos covering songs in 2008 and
        signed to RBMG, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bieber'>Bieber</a> released his debut EP, <i>My
            World</i>, in late 2009. It was certified platinum in the U.S. He became the first artist to have seven
        songs from a debut record chart on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Bieber released his first full-length
        studio album, <i>My World 2.0</i>, in 2010. It debuted at or near number one in several countries and was
        certified triple platinum in the U.S. It was preceded by his most successful single to date, "Baby".</p>
    <p>Following his debut album, he had his first headlining tour, the My World Tour, released the remix albums <i>My
        Worlds Acoustic</i> and <i>Never Say Never &#8211; The Remixes</i>&#8212;and the 3D biopic-concert film <i>Justin
        Bieber: Never Say Never</i>. He released his second studio album, <i>Under the Mistletoe</i>, in November
        2011, when it debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. Bieber released his third studio album, <i>Believe,</i>
        in 2012. His fourth studio album <i>Purpose</i> was released in November 2015. His U.S. album and singles
        sales total 44.7 million. He has sold an estimated 100 million records, making him one of the world&#8217;s
        best-selling music artists.</p>
    <p>He has won numerous fan-voted awards, including <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Music_Award'
    >American Music Award</a> for Artist of the Year
        in 2010 and 2012. In his career, he has received three Grammy nominations, winning one for <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Dance_Recording'>Best Dance Recording</a> for the
        song "Where Are &#220; Now" at the 2016 ceremony. His fan base, dubbed "beliebers", largely consists of
        early to mid-adolescent girls. He has been listed four times by <i>Forbes</i> magazine among the top ten
        most powerful celebrities in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Bieber also became the first artist to
        surpass 10 billion total video views on Vevo.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, in London, Ontario, at St Joseph's Hospital, and was raised in Stratford,
        Ontario. He is the only child of Jeremy Jack Bieber and Patricia "Pattie" Mallette. Bieber's parents were
        never married. Pattie raised her son with the help of her mother, Diane, and stepfather, Bruce. His mother
        is of French-Canadian descent; his paternal great-grandfather was of German ancestry, and his other roots
        are English and Irish. He has also stated that he believes that he has some undetermined Aboriginal Canadian
        ancestry.</p>
    <p>Through Jeremy, Bieber has two younger half-siblings, Jazmyn (born 2009) and Jaxon (born 2010). Pattie worked
        a series of low-paying office jobs, raising Bieber as a single mother in low-income housing. Bieber has
        maintained contact with his father.</p>
    <p>Bieber attended a French-language immersion elementary school in Stratford, the <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Sauv&#233;'>Jeanne Sauv&#233;</a> Catholic School.
        Growing up, he learned to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet. He graduated from high school in
        Stratford, Ontario, the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Michael_Catholic_Secondary_School'>St.
            Michael Catholic Secondary School</a> in 2012 with a 4.0 GPA. In early 2007, aged 12, Bieber sang
        Ne-Yo's
        "So Sick" for a local singing competition in Stratford and was placed second. Mallette posted a video of the
        performance on YouTube for their family and friends to see. She continued to upload videos of Bieber singing
        covers of various R&amp;B songs, and Bieber's popularity on the site grew.</p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <h3>2008&#8211;2010: Career beginnings and <i>My World</i></h3>
    <p>When searching for videos of a different singer, Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def
        Recordings, clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 videos by accident. Impressed, Braun tracked down the theatre
        Bieber was performing in, located Bieber's school, and finally contacted Mallette, who was reluctant because
        of Braun's Judaism. She remembered praying, "God, I gave him to you. You could send me a Christian man, a
        Christian label!", and, "God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?" However, church
        elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun. At 13, Bieber went to Atlanta, Georgia, with Braun to
        record demo tapes. Bieber began singing for Usher one week later.</p>

    <p>Bieber was soon signed to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture between Braun and Usher. <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake'>Justin Timberlake</a> was also reportedly
        in the running to sign Bieber but lost the bidding war to Usher. Usher then sought assistance in finding a
        label home for the artist from then manager Chris Hicks, who helped engineer an audition with his contact <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Reid'>L.A. Reid</a> of The Island Def Jam Music
        Group. Reid signed Bieber to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_Records'>Island Records</a>
        in October 2008 (resulting in a joint venture between RBMG and Island Records) and appointed Hicks as
        executive Vice-President of Def Jam, where he could manage Bieber's career at the label. Bieber then moved
        to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta'>Atlanta</a> with his mother to pursue further work
        with Braun and Usher. Braun became Bieber's manager in 2008.</p>
    <p>Bieber's first single, "One Time", was released to radio while Bieber was still recording his debut album.
        The song reached number 12 on the Canadian <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_100'>Hot 100</a>
        during its first week of release in July 2009 and later peaked at number 17 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100.
        During fall 2009, it had success in international markets. The song was certified platinum in Canada and the
        US and gold in Australia and New Zealand. His first release, an extended play entitled <i>My World</i>, was
        released on November 17, 2009. The album's second single, "One Less Lonely Girl", and two promo singles,
        "Love Me" and "Favorite Girl", were released exclusively on the iTunes Store and charted within the top 40
        of the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100.</p>
    <p>"One Less Lonely Girl" was later also released to radio and peaked within the top 20 in Canada and the US,
        and was certified gold in the latter. <i>My World</i> was eventually certified platinum in the US and double
        platinum in both Canada and the United Kingdom. To promote the album, Bieber performed on several live shows
        such as mtvU's VMA 09 Tour, European program <i>The Dome</i>, YTV's <i>The Next Star</i>, <i>The Today
            Show</i>, <i>The Wendy Williams Show</i>, <i>Lopez Tonight</i>, <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i>, <i>It's
            On with Alexa Chung</i>, <i>Good Morning America</i>, <i>Chelsea Lately</i>, and BET's <i>106 &amp;
            Park</i>. Bieber also guest starred in an episode of <i>True Jackson, VP</i> in late 2009.</p>
    <p>Bieber performed Ron Miller and Bryan Wells's "Someday at Christmas" for US President <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama'>Barack Obama</a> and first lady <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama'>Michelle Obama</a> at the <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House'>White House</a> for <i>Christmas in
        Washington</i>, which aired on December 20, 2009 on US television broadcaster TNT. Bieber was also one of
        the performers for <i>Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve</i> with Ryan Seacrest, on December 31, 2009.
        Bieber was a presenter at the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/52nd_Annual_Grammy_Awards'>52nd
            Annual Grammy Awards</a> on January 31, 2010. He was invited to be a vocalist for the remake of "We Are
        the
        World" (a song written by <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson'>Michael Jackson</a>
        and Lionel Richie) for its 25th anniversary to benefit <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti'>Haiti</a>
        after the earthquake. Bieber sings the opening line, which was sung by <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Richie'>Lionel Richie</a> in the original version.
    </p>
    <p>On March 12, 2010, a version of K'naan's "Wavin' Flag", recorded by a collective of Canadian musicians known
        as Young Artists for Haiti, was released. Bieber is featured in the song, performing the closing lines.</p>
    <h3>2010&#8211;2011: <i>My World 2.0</i> and <i>Never Say Never</i></h3>
    <p>In January 2010, "Baby", was released from his debut album, <i>My World 2.0</i>. The song featured Ludacris,
        and became an international hit. It charted at number five on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, peaked at
        number three on the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Hot_100'>Canadian Hot 100</a> and
        reached the top ten in several international markets. Two promo singles "Never Let You Go", and "U Smile"
        were top thirty hits on the US Hot 100, and top twenty hits in Canada. According to review aggregator
        Metacritic, the album has received generally favourable reviews. It debuted at number one on the US
        <i>Billboard</i>
        200, making Bieber the youngest solo male act to top the chart since <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder'>Stevie Wonder</a> in 1963. <i>My World
            2.0</i> also debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, Irish Albums Chart, Australian Albums
        Chart, and the New Zealand Albums Chart and reached the top ten of fifteen other countries.</p>
    <p>To promote the album, Bieber appeared on several live programs including <i>The View</i>, the 2010 Kids'
        Choice Awards, <i>Nightline</i>, <i>Late Show with David Letterman</i>, <i>The Dome</i> and <i>106 &amp;
            Park</i>. <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Kingston'>Sean Kingston</a> appeared on the
        album's next single, "Eenie Meenie". The song reached the top ten in the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom'>United Kingdom</a> and Australia, and the
        top-twenty of most other markets. On April 10, 2010, Bieber was the musical guest on <i>Saturday Night
            Live</i>. On July 4, 2010, Bieber performed at the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy' s' target=''
        />Macy's</a> Fourth of July Fireworks Spectacular in New York City. The following single from <i>My World
            2.0</i>, "Somebody to Love", was released in April 2010, and a remix was released featuring Bieber's
        mentor Usher. On June 23, 2010, Bieber went on his first official headlining tour, the My World Tour,
        starting in Hartford, Connecticut, to promote <i>My World</i> and <i>My World 2.0</i>. In July 2010, it was
        reported that Bieber was the most searched for celebrity on the Internet. That same month his music video
        for "Baby", surpassed Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance" to become the most viewed, and also the most disliked
        YouTube video ever. However, Taylor Swift's <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Blank_Space'>Blank
            Space</a> surpassed its number of views in 2015. In September 2010, it was reported that Bieber
        accounted
        for three per cent of all traffic on Twitter, according to an employee of the social-networking site.</p>

    <p>In Bieber's second album, because of puberty, his voice was deeper than it was in his first album. In April
        2010, the singer discussing his vocals remarked, "It cracks. Like every teenage boy, I'm dealing with it and
        I have the best vocal coach in the world. [...] Some of the notes I hit on "Baby" I can't hit any more. We
        have to lower the key when I sing live." Bieber guest-starred in the season premiere of the CBS crime drama
        <i>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</i>, which aired on September 23, 2010. He played a "troubled teen who is
        faced with a difficult decision regarding his only brother", who is also a serial bomber. Bieber was also in
        a subsequent episode which aired on February 17, 2011, in which his character is killed. Bieber performed a
        medley of "U Smile", "Baby", and "Somebody to Love" and briefly played the drums at the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_MTV_Video_Music_Awards'>2010 MTV Video Music
            Awards</a> on September 12, 2010. Bieber announced in October 2010 that he would be releasing an
        acoustic
        album, called <i>My Worlds Acoustic</i>. It was released on November 26, 2010 in the United States and
        featured acoustic versions of songs from his previous albums, and accompanied the release of a new song
        titled "Pray". In 2012, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.</p>
    <p>A 3-D part-biopic, part-concert film starring Bieber entitled <i>Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</i>, was
        released on February 11, 2011, directed by <i>Step Up 3D</i> director Jon Chu. It topped the box office with
        an estimated gross of $12.4 million on its opening day from 3,105 theatres. It grossed $30.3 million for the
        weekend and was narrowly beaten by the romantic comedy <i>Just Go with It</i>, which grossed $31 million.
        <i>Never Say Never</i> reportedly exceeded industry expectations, nearly matching the $31.1 million grossed
        by Miley Cyrus's 2008 3-D concert film, Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert, which
        holds the record for the top debut for a music-documentary. <i>Never Say Never</i> grossed a total of
        $98,441,954 worldwide. The film is accompanied by his second remix album, <i>Never Say Never &#8211; The
            Remixes</i>, released February 14, 2011, and features remixes of songs from his debut album, with guest
        appearances from Miley Cyrus, Chris Brown, and Kanye West, among others.</p>
    <p>In June 2011, Bieber was ranked #2 on the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes'>Forbes</a>
        list of Best-Paid Celebrities under 30. He is the youngest star, and 1 of 7 musicians on the list, having
        raked in $53 million in a 12-month period. On November 1, 2011, Bieber released the Christmas-themed <i>Under
            the Mistletoe</i>, his second studio album. It debuted at #1 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, selling
        210,000 copies in its first week of release.</p>
    <h3>2011&#8211;2015: <i>Believe</i>, <i>Journals</i>, and other appearances</h3>
    <p>In late 2011, Bieber began recording his third studio album, entitled <i>Believe</i>. The following week,
        Bieber appeared on <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i> to announce that the first single would be called
        "Boyfriend" and would be released on March 26, 2012. The song debuted at number two on the US
        <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart, selling a total of 521,000 digital units, the second-highest-ever debut
        digital sales week. Bill Werde of <i>Billboard</i> noted that it failed to debut at number one because the
        digital download of the track was available only through iTunes Store, "restricting the buying option for
        those that do not frequent the Apple retail store". "Boyfriend" became Bieber's first single ever to reach
        the top position on the Canadian Hot 100 by debuting at number one and staying on for one week.</p>

    <p>His third studio album, <i>Believe</i> was released on June 19, 2012, by Island Records. The album marks a
        musical departure from the teen pop sound of his previous releases, and incorporates elements of dance-pop
        and R&amp;B genres. Intent on developing a more "mature" sound, Bieber collaborated with a wide range of
        urban producers for the release as well as some long-time collaborators, including Darkchild, Hit-Boy,
        Diplo, and Max Martin. <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> praised Bieber's musical shift, calling the album both a
        "reinvention and a reintroduction". <i>Rolling Stone</i> noted the deeper voice and more "intense" beats
        found on the album, although it lampooned one of his euphemisms for newfound sexual maturity ("If you spread
        your wings, you can fly away with me"). <i>Believe</i> debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200,
        becoming his fourth number-one album. The album sold 57,000 copies in its first week in Canada, debuting
        atop the Canadian Albums Chart.</p>
    <p>The Believe Tour, which further promoted the album, began in September 2012 in Glendale, Arizona. On December
        14, 2012, Bieber appeared on <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i>, where he announced plans to release an
        acoustic album titled <i>Believe Acoustic</i>, which was released on January 29, 2013.</p>
    <p>Bieber returned to <i>Saturday Night Live</i> as the host and musical guest of February 9, 2013 episode. His
        appearance was panned by critics and cast members, including Kate McKinnon, who stated that Bieber was not
        comfortable with his hosting duties, and Bill Hader, who stated that he did not enjoy the presence of Bieber
        or his entourage. Hader added that in his eight years on the program, Bieber was the only host who lived up
        to his reputation.</p>
    <p>On March 7, 2013, Bieber fainted backstage at London's O2 Arena after complaining of breathing problems
        throughout his performance and was taken to hospital. Bieber cancelled his second Lisbon, Portugal concert
        at the Pavilh&#227;o Atl&#226;ntico, which was to be held on March 12, because of low ticket sales. The
        concert on March 11 went on. In mid-August 2013, a remixed duet version of Michael Jackson's previously
        unreleased song "Slave To The Rhythm", featuring Justin Bieber leaked online. In response to criticism over
        this remix, the MJ Estate had not authorized release of this recording, and has since made attempts to
        remove the song from as many sites and YouTube channels as possible. Later, a song titled "Twerk" by rapper
        Lil Twist, featuring Bieber as well as Miley Cyrus, also leaked.</p>
    <p>On October 3, 2013, Bieber announced that he would release a new song every Monday for 10 weeks as a lead-up
        to the film <i>Justin Bieber's Believe</i>, which entered production in May 2012 and was released on
        December 25, 2013. The film is a follow-up to <i>Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</i>, and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_M._Chu'>Jon M. Chu</a> returned to direct. The first
        song of Music Mondays, "Heartbreaker", was released on October 7. The second song, "All That Matters", was
        released on October 14, followed by "Hold Tight" on October 21, "Recovery" on October 28, "Bad Day" on
        November 4, and "All Bad" on November 11. The seventh song, "PYD" featuring R. Kelly, was released on
        November 18; it was followed by "Roller Coaster" on November 25, and "Change Me" on December 2. The final
        song, "Confident" featuring Chance the Rapper, was released on December 9, 2013. That same day, it was
        announced that all 10 tracks will be featured on an upcoming collection called <i>Journals</i>. It
        reportedly featured five additional unreleased songs, a music video for "All That Matters", and a trailer
        for <i>Believe</i>. <i>Journals</i> was only available for purchase via iTunes for a limited time only: from
        December 23, 2013 to January 9, 2014. The titles of the five new additional songs are: "One Life",
        "Backpack" featuring Lil Wayne, "What's Hatinin" featuring Future, "Swap It Out", and "Memphis" featuring <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sean'>Big Sean</a> and Diplo. Bieber released a song
        titled "Home to Mama" featuring Australian singer <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Simpson'
        >Cody Simpson</a> in November 2014.</p>
    <p>Because of the disbanding of Universal Music's division, The Island Def Jam Music Group, in April 2014,
        Bieber and a number of artists were subsequently transferred to a UMG related division Def Jam Recordings,
        causing Bieber and the other artists to no longer be signed to Island Records.</p>
    <p>In February 2015, Bieber released a song "Where Are &#220; Now", with Jack &#220;. In March 2015, Bieber made
        an appearance in the music video for Carly Rae Jepsen's single "I Really Like You".</p>
    <p>In March 2015 Bieber was the featured roastee in Comedy Central's annual roast special. Bieber filmed an
        episode for the Fox TV reality series <i>Knock Knock Live</i>, and aired before the show was cancelled after
        two episodes.</p>

    <p>On August 28, 2015, Bieber released a new single titled "What Do You Mean?" as the lead single from his
        fourth studio album <i>Purpose</i>. The song is a blend of teen pop, electronic dance music and acoustic R&amp;B
        and became Bieber's first number-one single on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. He became the youngest male
        artist to debut at the top of that chart, earning him a Guinness World Record. On October 23, 2015, Bieber
        released the album's second single titled "Sorry" as an instant download, with the pre-order of the album on
        iTunes. The song debuted at number two on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. After eight non-consecutive weeks at
        number two, on the week charting January 23, 2016, "Sorry" climbed to the top spot of the chart and became
        Bieber's second number-one single on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. The third single from <i>Purpose</i>,
        "Love Yourself" also peaked at number one in the US, making Bieber the first male artist in almost a decade
        to have three number-ones from an album since Justin Timberlake last did it with his album <i>FutureSex/LoveSounds</i>
        in 2006/2007. "Company" was announced as the fourth single on March 8, 2016. On February 12, 2016, Bieber's
        first four albums were released on vinyl for the first time.</p>
    <p><i>Purpose</i> was released on November 13, 2015 and debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200,
        becoming Bieber's sixth album to debut at the top of that chart. It was the fourth best-selling album of
        2015 with worldwide sales of 3.1 million copies. As of June 2016, it had sold 4.5 million copies globally.
        On November 11, 2015, Bieber announced he will embark on the Purpose Tour. The tour started in Seattle,
        Washington on March 9, 2016.</p>
    <p>On July 22, 2016, Bieber released a new single with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Lazer'
    >Major Lazer</a> and <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/M&#216;'>M&#216;</a> titled "Cold Water". It debuted at number
        two, on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, becoming Bieber's third number-two debut on the chart, passing Mariah
        Carey's record to become the artist with the most number-two debuts; he also leads with the most top-two
        debuts at five.</p>
    <h2>Artistry</h2>
    <h3>Musical style and influences</h3>
    <p>Bieber's music is generally pop, while he also incorporates elements of R&amp;B. <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jody_Rosen'>Jody Rosen</a> of <i>Rolling Stone</i> asserted
        that the content of his music was "offering a gentle introduction to the mysteries and heartaches of
        adolescence: songs flushed with romance but notably free of sex itself." </p>
    <p>Bieber has cited The Beatles, Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Justin Timberlake, <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyz_II_Men'>Boyz II Men</a> and Usher as his musical
        inspirations. Bieber stated <i>My World 2.0</i> was influenced by Timberlake.</p>
    <h3>Voice</h3>
    <p>After initially singing in his adolescent voice since his debut, he began to experience changes during a
        performance of &#8220;Pray&#8221; at the 2011 American music awards as a result of puberty. He started to
        receive vocal conditioning from vocal coach Jan Smith, until fully transitioning into his new adult voice.
        <i>The Guardian'</i>s Sean Michaels described it as "the biggest threat to his career" at the time.</p>
    <p>In a review of his <i>Purpose</i> album, Neil McCormick of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> complimented his "soft,
        supple and seductive singing". Caroline Sullivan of <i>The Guardian</i> also praised Bieber&#8217;s
        "affectedly breathy voice", but insisted in the same sentence that "the voice soon palls" after listening to
        the whole album.</p>
    <h2>Public image</h2>
    <h3>General</h3>

    <p>Usher commented that while he and Bieber were both signed at the same age, "I had the chance to ramp up my
        success, where this has happened to Bieber abruptly". As a result, Usher, Braun, Bieber's bodyguard, and
        other adults surrounding Bieber constantly coach him on handling fame and his public image. After signing
        Bieber, Usher appointed one of his former assistants, Ryan Good, to be Bieber's road manager and stylist.
        Good, once nicknamed Bieber's "swagger coach", created a "streetwise look" for the singer which consisted of
        baseball caps, hoodies, dog chains, and flashy sneakers. Amy Kaufman of <i>The <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles'>Los Angeles</a> Times</i> comments, "Though a
        product of a middle-class suburban upbringing in Stratford, Ontario, Bieber's manner of dress and speech
        ('Wassup man, how you doin'?' or 'It's like, you know, whateva' ') suggest he's mimicking his favourite
        rappers." In 2013, Bieber said that he was "very influenced by black culture", but he neither thought "of it
        as black or white" nor tried to "act or pose in a certain way". To him, it was "a lifestyle&#8212;like a
        suaveness or a swag". Wax statues of him with his hairstyle from that of his earlier career are on display
        at the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Tussauds'>Madame Tussauds</a> wax museums in
        Amsterdam, London, and New York City.</p>

    <p>Bieber is often featured in teen magazines, such as <i>Tiger Beat</i>, and has been labelled as a "teen
        heartthrob". In 2010, he was frequently criticized for looking and sounding younger than his age, and the
        following year for an androgynous appearance, which had been commonly noted in the media, including his
        appearance on the cover of <i>LOVE</i> magazine's androgyny issue in 2011. His teen-pop music, image
        (especially as a heartthrob to young teenage girls), and the media attention he receives have additionally
        been criticized. He has been a target of Internet bloggers and message board posters, especially users of
        the Internet message board <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan'>4chan</a> and of YouTube.
        Nick Collins of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> said that "Bieber's character appears to strike a particularly
        sour note with his Internet critics" who have questioned his manner of speech, among other things.</p>
    <p>Bieber's early fanbase developed on YouTube and predated the release of his first album. <i>Chicago
        Tribune</i> noted that Bieber's fanbase, "Beliebers", was among the top words of 2010.</p>
    <h3>YouTube and Twitter</h3>
    <p>According to Jan Hoffman of <i>The New York Times</i>, part of Bieber's appeal stems from his YouTube
        channel. Long before the November 2009 release of the <i>My World</i> EP, his YouTube videos attracted
        millions of views. Braun recognized the appeal. Before flying him to Atlanta, Braun wanted to "build him up
        more on YouTube first" and had Bieber record more home videos for the channel. "I said: 'Justin, sing like
        there&#8217;s no one in the room. But let's not use expensive cameras.' We'll give it to kids, let them do
        the work, so that they feel like it's theirs", recalled Braun. Bieber continues to upload videos to the same
        channel and has opened a <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter'>Twitter</a> account, from
        which he interacts with fans regularly; his account was reported in November 2010 to have more than six
        million followers. Bieber surpassed <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga'>Lady Gaga</a>
        for having the most followed person on Twitter in January 2013. In early November 2013, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry'>Katy Perry</a> surpassed him for having the
        most followers.</p>
    <p>Bieber was frequently a trending topic on Twitter when the feature first launched because his fans frequently
        discussed him on the network, and he was named the top trending star on Twitter in 2010; <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Klout'>Klout</a> gave his account a score of 100. In April
        2013, the social media analysis company <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialbakers'>Socialbakers</a>
        concluded that 16.7 million of Bieber's 37 million Twitter followers are not genuine.</p>
    <h2>Personal life</h2>
    <h3>Beliefs and relationships</h3>
    <p>Bieber identifies himself as a faithful adherent of Christianity, said he communicates with God via prayer,
        and that "he's the reason I'm here". He reflected his faith in a music video with Brandon Burke, titled
        "#iPledge", in which he "talks candidly about his appreciation for the tenet of forgiveness in the Christian
        faith". Regarding sexual abstinence, he told music magazine <i>Rolling Stone</i>, "I don't think you should
        have sex with anyone unless you love them." He added that he does not "believe in abortion", and that it is
        "like killing a baby"; when asked about the case of abortion with regard to rape, however, he said, "I guess
        I haven't been in that position, so I wouldn't be able to judge that." His view on sexual orientation is
        quoted as "everyone's own decision", and he has contributed to the It Gets Better Project, a non-profit
        group aiming to prevent suicide among LGBT youth.</p>
    <p>As Bieber resides in the United States, he is reported to possess an O-1 visa for temporary resident status,
        based on "extraordinary ability or achievement" in a field. Bieber has stated that he is not interested in
        obtaining US citizenship because of his view on America's market-oriented health care system. He has praised
        Canada as being "the best country in the world" citing its government-run health care system as a model
        example. According to Scooter Braun, he has also stated that he regularly cites the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_prayer'>Jewish prayer</a> <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Shema_Yisrael'>Shema Yisrael</a> before every live show
        showcasing his view on multiculturalism. In December 2010, he was in a relationship with Selena Gomez. In
        January 2013, it was reported that he was single.</p>
    <p>Bieber's father, Jeremy Bieber, is a former carpenter and pro-am mixed martial artist. In March 2014, <i>Rolling
        Stone</i> characterized Jeremy as having "split with Justin's mom when Justin was a toddler, and wasn't
        always around afterward. But he has, as of late, accepted a place of honor in his superstar son's
        entourage".</p>
    <p>In 2016, Bieber began dating Sofia Richie. Bieber took Richie to Mexico to celebrate her 18th birthday.</p>
    <h3>Endorsements, products, and philanthropy</h3>
    <p>Aside from his career as a musician, Bieber has ventured into the worlds of business and philanthropy.</p>
    <p>He has become an angel investor for technology companies and made his first startup investment in 2009. Since
        then, he has quietly invested millions of dollars in a dozen small technology start-ups including Shots,
        game-for-good company SoJo Studios, Spotify, and Stamped. He has said that he does not plan to invest in
        something he does not like, as he has to believe in the product.</p>
    <p>Bieber endorsed Adidas, beside <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Rose'>Derrick Rose</a>
        and Venus Williams, in 2012.</p>
    <p>He became the new "face" and "body" of <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Klein'>Calvin
        Klein</a> in early 2015.</p>
    <p>In June 2015, Bieber teamed up with StarShop, a new shopping app launched by Kevin Harrington.</p>
    <p>Bieber has bandwagoned four fragrances as of 2014. He launched his debut fragrance, Someday, in 2011; it
        grossed more than three million US dollars in sales, at Macy's, in just under three weeks, which industry
        experts regard as a successful celebrity-led launch. On the heels of that 2011 best-seller, he launched his
        second fragrance, Girlfriend, in June 2012. His third fragrance, The Key, was launched in July 2013, and his
        latest fragrance, Justin Bieber Collector's Edition, launched in 2014.</p>
    <p>Bieber supports Pencils of Promise, a charity founded by Adam Braun, the younger brother of Bieber's manager.
        The organization builds schools in developing countries, and Bieber became manager for the organization's
        campaign in Guatemala. He serves as a celebrity spokesman for the organization by running ads for the
        charity and its campaign "Schools4All". He promises to visit schools that donate the most funds to the
        organization. He takes part in the charity's fund-raising galas and donates parts of the proceeds from his
        concerts and Someday line of fragrances, and various merchandising to the charity.</p>
    <p>He also appears in an animal welfare PSA for <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/PETA'>PETA</a>
        encouraging people to volunteer at and adopt from animal shelters instead of buying pets from breeders or
        pet stores.</p>
    <h3>Legal issues and controversy</h3>

    <p>Bieber had several run-ins with the law around the world before his first arrest in 2014, including when he
        was accused of reckless driving in his neighbourhood in 2012, and charged in <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil'>Brazil</a> with vandalism in 2013. One of his
        neighbours in Calabasas, California, accused Bieber of throwing eggs at his home on January 9, 2014, and
        causing thousands of dollars of damage. On January 23, 2014, Bieber was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida,
        together with singer Khalil on suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI), driving with an over six
        month expired license, and resisting arrest without violence. Police said that Bieber told authorities he
        had consumed alcohol, smoked marijuana, and taken prescription drugs. He has been released from these
        charges on a $2,500 bond, and lack of evidence beyond reasonable doubt as dictated in the United States
        court of law. A toxicology report revealed that Bieber had <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/THC'
        >THC</a> (a principal constituent of
        cannabis) and the anti-anxiety medication Xanax in his system at the time of his arrest.</p>
    <p>Following Bieber's arrest on the DUI charge, more than 270,000 persons petitioned the White House seeking to
        have him deported from the United States. Although the number of signatures received was sufficient to
        require a response under published White House guidelines; it has been noted that the Obama Administration
        has declined substantive comment on the petition. Immigration Law expert <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_York'>Harlan York</a> noted that the likeliness of
        Bieber being deported was extremely slim. York stated, "About a decade ago, the Supreme Court ruled that
        driving under the influence, typically, is not a basis to deport someone."</p>
    <p>On July 9, 2014, Bieber was charged with one misdemeanour count of vandalism in <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/California'>California</a> for throwing eggs at his Calabasas
        neighbour's home in January. Police earlier claimed that they had video footage of him high-fiving friends
        after the eggs were thrown. With him pleading no contest to the charge, the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Superior_Court'>Los Angeles County
            Superior Court</a> sentenced him on July 9 to pay US$80,900 in restitution, serve two years' probation,
        complete twelve weeks of anger management, and five days of community service in what the district attorney
        termed a negotiated settlement. Since then, he has permanently moved to <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills,_California'>Beverly Hills, California</a>
        after the incident.</p>
    <p>On August 13, 2014, the January DUI case was settled with a plea bargain pleading guilty to resisting an
        officer without violence, and a lesser charge of driving without due care and attention. He has been fined
        with US$500 and sentenced to attend both a 12-hour anger management course, and a program that teaches about
        the impact of drunken driving on victims. As part of the plea bargain, he has made a US$50,000 contribution
        to <i>Our Kids</i>, a local children's charity.</p>

    <p>On September 1, 2014, Bieber was arrested and charged with assault and dangerous driving near his hometown of
        <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratford,_Ontario'>Stratford, Ontario</a> after a collision
        between a minivan and Bieber's all-terrain vehicle on August 29. Ontario police said that he then "engaged
        in a physical altercation" with an occupant of the minivan. He was released shortly and his lawyer blamed
        the incident on "the unwelcome presence of paparazzi". On September 8, Toronto dropped an assault charge
        against him originally brought up on January 29 for an incident with a limousine driver in December 2013. In
        November 2014, he was ordered to appear in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina'
        >Argentina</a> within 60 days by a <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires'>Buenos Aires</a> court to give testimony on
        an alleged assault on a photographer on November 9, 2013. When he failed to do so, an arrest warrant was
        issued and two of his bodyguards were released in Argentina in April 2015.</p>
    <p>In June 2014, a video emerged of a 15-year-old Bieber telling a joke about black people, which used the word
        "nigger" multiple times. In the same month, a second video showed a 14-year-old Bieber giggling as he croons
        his song "One Less Lonely Girl", but parodying the main lyric as "One less lonely nigger", and stating that
        if he were to kill one, he would be "part of the KKK". He apologized the day the latter was released:
        "Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I've ever dealt with."</p>
