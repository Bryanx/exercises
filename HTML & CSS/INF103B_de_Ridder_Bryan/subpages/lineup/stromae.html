    <p><b>Paul Van Haver</b> (born 12 March 1985, Brussels), better known by his stage name <b>Stromae</b>, is a Belgian
        musician, singer, rapper and songwriter. Stromae was born to a Rwandan father, Pierre Rutare, and a Belgian
        mother, Miranda Marie Van Haver. He is originally from Laeken, in Brussels. He established himself in both the
        hip hop and electronic music genres. Stromae came to wide public attention in 2009 with his song "Alors on
        danse", which became a number one in several European countries. In 2013, his second album <i>Racine
            carr&#233;e</i> was a commercial success, selling 2 million copies in France alone and nearly 600,000 units
        elsewhere.</p>
    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>Stromae was born in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium'>Belgium</a> to a <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutsi'>Tutsi</a> father and a <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish'>Flemish</a>
        mother. His father, a successful Rwandan architect, was killed during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide. His mother
        raised him and his four siblings in Brussels, and later in a nearby suburb. She encouraged each of her children
        to play a sport and an instrument. Stromae studied percussion. His mother placed him in a Roman Catholic <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit'>Jesuit</a> school after he failed in the public school system at
        the age of sixteen. He formed a small rap group with friends while still in school. His early influences
        included Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel, Cuban son, and Congolese rumba. He did not always feel that he
        was from Belgium, even though he was raised as a Belgian. He always saw himself more connected to his Rwandan
        side; some believe that is the source of his talent. This "outsider" image became part of his appeal.</p>
    <h2>Musical career</h2>
    <h3>2000&#8211;07: Early career</h3>
    <p>In 2000, he appeared as a rapper called Opsmaestro, though he later changed his stage name to "Stromae", which is
        "Maestro" with the syllables reversed in a French vernacular practice called verlan.</p>
    <p>At the age of 18, he founded a rap group called "Suspicion", along with rapper "J.E.D.I." in Eichof. They
        produced the song and music video "Faut que t'arr&#234;te le Rap..." before J.E.D.I. decided to leave the rap
        duo. To finance his private school education, Van Haver worked part-time in the hospitality industry, but his
        academic performance wasn't up to standard. It was only later, when he registered at the Institut national de
        radio&#233;lectricit&#233; et cin&#233;matographie, that he released his first album "Juste un cerveau, un flow,
        un fond et un mic...".</p>
    <h3>2007&#8211;08: Debut EP and record career</h3>
    <p>In 2007, during his studies at the film school of Brussels, Stromae decided to concentrate fully on his musical
        career. This resulted in his debut-EP "Juste un cerveau, un flow, un fond et un mic&#8230;". In 2008 he signed a
        4-year record deal with "Because Music" and "Kiloma&#238;tre".</p>
    <h3>2009&#8211;12: Breakthrough and international success
    </h3>

    <p>In 2008, Stromae worked as a young trainee at the music radio station NRJ in Brussels. Vincent Verbelen, Music
        Manager, was impressed by the talent he perceived in Stromae's first single "Alors on danse" and decided to air
        it for the first time on NRJ. The response from listeners (including influential personalities ranging from <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour'>Anna Wintour</a> and Jean-Claude Van Damme, to the
        then-president of France Nicolas Sarkozy) was one of extreme enthusiasm and Stromae came to wider public
        attention. In a few weeks from that point, sales of the song established it as number one in Belgium.</p>
    <p>Vertigo Records, a label of <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Records'>Mercury Records</a> France
        (Universal Music Group), signed him for a worldwide licensing deal soon after this.</p>
    <p>By May 2010 the track "Alors on danse" had reached number one in Belgium, France, Sweden, Greece, Germany,
        Austria, Turkey, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark, Romania and the Czech Republic.</p>
    <p>On 2 September, Stromae collaborated with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West'>Kanye West</a> in a
        remix of his hit "Alors on danse". In 2010, he was nominated for Best Dutch and Belgian Act at the MTV <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe'>Europe</a> Music Awards.</p>
    <p>Of his music and influences, he has said: "I was in a little group doing rap music. I thought that rather than
        copying the French sound, I'd focus on a more American style but give it a European spin. And then I
        rediscovered 90s Eurodance. For a long time we were ashamed of that sound but in fact there's a lot to discover.
        It has its roots in everything from house to salsa. I also really admire <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Brel'>Jacques Brel</a> &#8211; he has been a huge influence on
        me &#8211; but also all sorts of other stuff, Cuban son, and the Congolese rumba, that I heard as a child; that
        music rocked the whole of Africa." Also, Stromae insists he wanted to collaborate with up and coming rap group
        Swag+5 featuring rapper T-Jay. In the end, the collaboration did not take place, but Stromae is a big fan of the
        America-based group. The critic Molloy Woodcraft&#160;: "He combines 90s electro synths and beats with a
        laidback delivery to mesmeric effect".</p>
    <p>He is one of the ten winners of the <i>European Border Breakers Award</i> 2011. On 9 February 2011, his debut
        album <i>Cheese</i> (including the hit single "Alors on danse") won the award for Best Dance Album at the <i>Victoires
            de la musique</i>.</p>
    <p>On 23 May 2011, during the recording of the French TV show Taratata, Stromae did a mashup of "Alors on danse" and
        "Don't Stop the Party" with the Black Eyed Peas. Stromae also announced he would perform as opening support act
        for the first of two concerts by the band in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris'>Paris</a> on 24 and 25
        June 2011 at Stade De France. Stromae had previously met will.i.am at the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/NRJ_Music_Awards'>NRJ Music Awards</a> in January. will.i.am told him
        that he liked "Alors on danse" and said he wanted to collaborate with Stromae.</p>
    <p>In 2011, he received one nomination for Best Belgian Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards.</p>
    <h3>2013&#8211;present: <i>Racine carr&#233;e</i></h3>
    <p>The first single "Papaoutai" from his second album <i>Racine carr&#233;e</i> (English: Square root) was digitally
        released on 13 May 2013. It went on to chart number 1 in Belgium and France, number 2 in the Netherlands, as
        well as number 7 in Germany and Switzerland.</p>
    <p>On 22 May 2013, amateur-looking videos appeared on <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube'>YouTube</a>
        showing Stromae, apparently drunk and wandering at the Louiza tram station in <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels'>Brussels</a> at dawn. The videos went viral. A few days later,
        it was revealed that this was linked with the filming of a professional music video. This was confirmed during
        an appearance by Stromae on the French TV show <i>Ce soir ou jamais</i> in which he discussed and also performed
        his new single "Formidable", which is about the story of a drunk man just separated from his girlfriend. The
        clip was made from edited hidden camera footage taken on 22 May. It also shows people taking pictures with their
        cellphones, people who are clearly irritated by his drunk actions, people helping him stand up, and three
        policemen asking if the artist is ok or if he needs some help. The policemen also got some critiques for not
        acting against the drunk Stromae; however, they later declared that the entire story was not shown. The part
        where they returned and Stromae had to explain his case was not broadcast.</p>
    <p>On 26 July 2013, Stromae announced on his Facebook and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter'>Twitter</a>
        accounts that he had completed his second studio album <i>Racine carr&#233;e</i> or <i>&#8730;</i> and that it
        would be released on 16 August 2013. On 25 August 2013, Stromae joined Major Lazer's show at French festival
        Rock en Seine, where he performed <i>Papaoutai</i>. In September 2013, Belgian rock band Mintzkov covered his
        song "Formidable/Wonderful" for a live session on Studio Brussel, with lyrics in English. In November 2013,
        Stromae received the award for Best Belgian Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards.</p>
    <p>On 17 March 2014, it was made public that Stromae's song "Ta f&#234;te" would become the official song for the
        Belgian national football team at the 2014 World Cup.</p>
    <p>In June 2014, in support of <i>Racine carr&#233;e</i>, Stromae made his US television debut on NBC's <i>Late
        Night with Seth Meyers</i>. He then embarked on a tour across the United States and performed at the <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy_Theater'>Best Buy Theater</a> in New York City. While in New York,
        on 22 June 2014, Stromae guest starred in a <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat'>Snapchat</a> story with
        <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Jarre'>Jerome Jarre</a> as The Carrot's Father.</p>
    <p>On 21 October 2014, it was revealed that New Zealand singer <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorde'>Lorde</a>
        invited Stromae to work on the soundtrack for <i>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay &#8211; Part 1</i> along with
        artists like Kanye West, Grace Jones, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplo'>Diplo</a> and The Chemical
        Brothers. He contributed to the song "Meltdown" which also features Pusha T, Q-Tip, Haim and Lorde herself.
        Earlier that month she declared herself a fan of Stromae after attending his concert. In March 2015, Stromae
        released a music video for the song "Carmen", which was directed by Sylvain Chomet. The video warns people
        against the addiction of social websites such as Twitter.</p>
    <p>Stromae continued touring the United States, performing in March 2015 in several places among which the <a
            href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/SXSW'>SXSW</a> in Austin, Texas. He was also among the line-up of the
        Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. He then began a tour in Africa on 13 May. However, in mid-June Stromae
        was forced to cancel the remaining of his shows until 2 August for health reasons. He performed at the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden'>Madison Square Garden</a> in October.</p>
    <p>On 14 September 2015, Stromae released a single "Quand c'est?", a song about cancer, which plays on the fact that
        "Quand c'est?" (When is it?) and "cancer" are phonetically similar in French.</p>
    <p>By the end of 2015, the album became the first in over a decade to reach 2 million sales in France.</p>
