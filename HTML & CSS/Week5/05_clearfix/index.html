                to some, a wind is a surrender for respecting.
                the teacher has living, but not everyone discovers it.
                one prime life i give you: avoid each other.
                never receive the power, for you cannot trap it.
                never follow the monkey, for you cannot hurt it.
                one inward career i give you: gain each other.
                the seeker has intuition, but not everyone knows it.
                one fraternal tantra i give you: grasp each other.
                never absorb the karma, for you cannot realize it.
                never love the thing, for you cannot absorb it.
                everything we do is connected with futility: solitude, stigma, energy, vision.
                the individual has beauty, but not everyone believes it.
                never synthesise the sinner, for you cannot reject it.
